# Cockpit V4 architecture

One Opus analyst. Four governed tools. A trace made of facts that happened.

## The shape

```
user question
  → POST /runs           persist run + outbox in ONE transaction, return 202
  → worker claims a lease
  → assemble small authorized context
  → ┌ generation ─────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │ the analyst chooses ONE action:                     │
    │   inspect_catalog   selected metadata               │
    │   inspect_product_knowledge  selected product facts │
    │   execute_analysis  its own exact SQL/Python        │
    │   read_artifact     exact stored evidence           │
    │   finalize_response the terminal answer             │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
  → validate · authorize · execute · persist artifacts
  → tool_result back to the analyst, in order
  → (repeat until finalize, or until a bound stops it)
  → validate the answer against the evidence
  → PERSIST the answer, THEN publish answer.ready
  → optional memory maintenance, separately bounded
```

A BROAD Product Help question — "Who are you?", "What is CreditProbe?", "What
are the seven functionalities?" — finishes in **one** generation with no tool
call: the ~924-token synopsis is already in the starting context, and
`product_knowledge.coverage` withholds `inspect_product_knowledge` from that
first action so the model is not invited to fetch what is in front of it. A
question that NAMES product detail the synopsis does not carry — Cockpit, TAC,
the four layers, Playbook, Graph Data — is offered the tool from the start and
costs a second generation for the retrieval. The withholding lasts one action:
the full tool set is restored for every action after the first, so a misjudged
question can never be stranded. The
deck is never attached wholesale, and a figure quoted in it is an illustration,
never a live portfolio value.

Ordinary help finishes in **one** generation. A simple analysis finishes in
**two** when the starting context already carries enough schema, or three when
one metadata lookup is needed. Those are architectural minimums, not promises
about a particular model's behaviour or elapsed time.

## Who is allowed to do what

| Component | May | Must not |
|---|---|---|
| The analyst (Opus) | understand the original wording, choose mode and owner, choose fields and method, write and repair code, assess evidence, write the answer | grant itself permissions or budget; treat dataset text as instructions |
| `context.py` | return exact authorized catalog/product/thread facts, paginate, redact | infer a business answer, invent a field, choose a method |
| `product_knowledge.py` | return exact recorded sections of the versioned pack, with slide provenance | answer a product question itself; surface the historical multi-agent slide as current |
| `intake.py` | normalise Unicode, whitespace and invisible control characters | correct spelling, translate, transliterate, fold case, expand an abbreviation, or change any number, date or name |
| `attention.py` | compute a published ranking over the pinned release and carry its evidence | interpret what a movement means, assert a cause, or call a model |
| `semantics.py` | state what the catalogue already defines, and resolve a period phrase against the calendar | invent a meaning the catalogue does not carry, or resolve a term with two defensible readings |
| `sqlbind.py` | prove the submitted SQL binds, and return the engine's own diagnostic when it does not | rewrite the query, substitute a column, or inline a parameter |
| `contracts.py` + `execute_tool.py` | validate schema, permissions, safety, grain, limits | rewrite a query, trim a step, substitute a field, compute a substitute answer |
| `execute_tool.py` runner | execute exactly the approved code in isolation | reach another domain, a credential, the shell, the network or host files |
| `orchestration.py` | carry messages, match tool ids, persist state, enforce counters and deadlines | repair the plan, the code or the answer; fall back to V3 |
| the UI | render persisted answers and events, collect clarification, cancel, reconnect | guess progress; claim a call succeeded without an event |
| `memory.py` | summarize completed history with turn-id citations | block delivery, invent facts, overwrite newer memory |

The one thing that is *not* authorship: deterministic formatting of a value
already bound to executed evidence. Rendering `5231.577413502459` as
`5,231.58 INR crore` at the declared precision is presentation. Changing which
column it came from is substance, and no code here can do it.

## Three properties that were built, not asserted

**Boundedness.** Every path back to the model consumes a generation attempt,
an execution submission, a round, a format allowance, a correction allowance
or elapsed time — none of which is replenished. `states.TRANSITIONS` records
what each cycle-closing edge spends, and a test fails the build if an edge
closes a cycle without naming one. The same bounds are also exercised against
the live loop, because a graph labelled with counters is not evidence that the
implementation increments them.

**Evidence.** A portfolio number reaches the user through a `numeric_claim`
bound to an artifact *this run* produced, carrying the exact stored value. The
narrative references it as `{{claim.id}}` and the renderer substitutes it at
the declared unit and precision. A claim that restates a figure rounded is
refused. A full answer that reports nothing bound to the evidence is refused.
A *partial* answer that states plainly what it could not establish is accepted
— that is the honest outcome, not an invalid one.

**Durability.** The run, its events, its submitted code, its artifacts and its
cost reservations are committed before the next side effect. `202` means
durable and claimable, not answered. The answer is persisted before
`answer.ready` is published. A worker that stops heartbeating is settled by an
independent supervisor as `INTERRUPTED`, and nothing paid is replayed on a
guess.

## The analysis-round rule

The first `execute_analysis` submission opens round 1. A failed or partly
failed batch may be repaired **within** that round. Only after a batch
completes successfully and its results reach the analyst does the next batch
open a new round. Metadata reads, artifact reads and finalization open no
round.

This avoids asking the orchestrator to judge whether two methods are
"substantively different" — a judgement it has no business making. A failed
batch may change method inside its repair; the five-submission, call, cost and
time limits still bound it.

## What V4 deliberately does not have

- No mandatory Sonnet preprocessing, and no `AI_COCKPIT_PREPROCESS_MODEL` on
  the answer path.
- No separate ownership round trip: intent is declared with the first action.
- No full catalogue in any prompt.
- No planning essay, no functionality-scoring essay, no summary-before-answer.
- No fallback to V3, to another model, or to a deterministic calculator.
- No multi-agent framework, vector database or hosted workflow platform.
