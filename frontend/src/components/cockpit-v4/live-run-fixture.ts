/**
 * The recorded live run `run-f1cf5a5ea98440b384f1ad99a7e1514e`.
 *
 * FIXTURE, from a real Opus run. The backend persisted these fifteen events
 * correctly and the browser rendered "Answered in 0s" with every stage still
 * "not started", because the server sends NAMED SSE frames and the client
 * listened only for `message`.
 *
 * Kept as data, in the order and shape the server produced, so the regression
 * is against what actually happened rather than against what we think happens.
