/**
 * The Cockpit thread: a conversation, not a page that answers once.
 *
 * The product problem this exists for
 * -----------------------------------
 * V4 could execute an analytical question and publish an evidence-bound
 * answer, and the experience was still a dashboard. You asked from a landing
 * page, one process panel appeared, one answer appeared, and to ask the
 * obvious next question you scrolled back up to the box you started in. There
 * was no transcript, so the second question felt like starting over, and the
 * answer read as the end of the interaction when the follow-up is the point.
 *
 * So: a thread. The question sits at the top, the process runs underneath it,
 * the answer appends below that, and the composer is waiting where your eye
 * already is. Ask again and the exchange appends -- it does not replace what
 * came before. Five questions render as five exchanges.
 *
 * What did NOT come back with the shape
 * --------------------------------------
 * None of the previous Cockpit's backend. No `/investigations`, no
 * `/agentic/officer`, no old Ask flow, no shim translating either. The run
 * lifecycle, the evidence model, the release binding and the numeric
 * rendering are V4's, unchanged by this file. This is the interaction the old
 * product got right, over the architecture the new one got right.
 *
 * Reloading is free
 * -----------------
 * The transcript is the server's. A refresh reads it back and re-follows only
 * a run that is genuinely still working -- it never re-asks, because asking
 * again spends the analysis twice and tells the reader nothing about the
 * first one.
