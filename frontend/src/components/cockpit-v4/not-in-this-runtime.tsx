/**
 * The neutral state for a widget whose backend is not part of this runtime.
 *
 * The isolated V4 UAT instance serves the Cockpit API and nothing else. Risk
 * cases, investigations, early warning, the legacy briefing and workspace
 * notifications are served by the main CreditProbe backend, which this
 * instance does not start.
 *
 * So those widgets do not call. A request that is going to 404 is not
 * diagnostics — it is noise in the API log and a red card on the screen, and
 * a page covered in red cards is one nobody can test a Cockpit in. Saying
 * plainly that the surface is not part of this runtime is both honest and
 * quiet.
