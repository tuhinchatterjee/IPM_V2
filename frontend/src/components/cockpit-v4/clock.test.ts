/**
 * Seconds that move while something is running.
 *
 * A stage that had been working for half a minute used to sit on screen at
 * "0.0s", because the panel showed the elapsed time from the last EVENT and
 * events do not arrive during a model call. The application looked frozen at
 * exactly the moment it was working hardest.
 *
 * Time is driven by hand here. Asserting a one-second tick by sleeping for a
 * second makes a suite slower and no more certain.
