"""
Canonical Cockpit semantics: what a term means when it has one meaning.

The defect this exists for
--------------------------
A live run recorded these, honestly, as ambiguities:

    "Exposure read as reported EAD (ead_reported), not gross carrying amount."
    "Period not specified: using the latest populated quarter 2026Q2 against
     2026Q1."
    "ECL read as booked ECL (ecl_reported)."

Every one is a correct resolution, written down for the reader. None of them
is a question. But `Intent.may_execute` required an EMPTY ambiguities list, so
recording a resolution blocked the analysis that the resolution made possible.
Careful behaviour was penalised, and the only way to run was to say nothing.

So the three things get three names:

  * a BLOCKING AMBIGUITY is a term with two defensible readings that would
    produce materially different numbers. It stops execution and is worth one
    targeted question.
  * a RESOLVED ASSUMPTION is a choice that has been made and is being
    declared. It belongs in the trace and in the answer's own words. It does
    not stop anything.
  * a CANONICAL MAPPING is a term this domain already defines. It is not even
    a choice.

What is here, and what is not
-----------------------------
Only mappings the catalogue supports. Nothing in this module invents a meaning,
and every entry names the field it resolves to so a reader can check it against
`inspect_catalog`. Where the catalogue genuinely offers two readings -- the
bare word "exposure" is the real case -- there is no canonical mapping and the
term is listed as one that needs a question.
