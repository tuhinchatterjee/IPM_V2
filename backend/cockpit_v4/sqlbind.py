"""
Proving a query bindable before saying it was validated.

The defect this exists for
--------------------------
A live run showed "Query validated", then failed "at the bind check". Both
statements were true and the order was wrong: validation checked the SQL's
structure and that its relations were authorized, announced success, and only
then — inside the executor — asked DuckDB whether the query resolved at all.

The binder failure itself had a specific cause. `execute_analysis` publishes a
`parameters` object on every step, so a model following the schema may write
`WHERE reporting_quarter = ?` and supply the value there. Nothing carried that
object to the engine. DuckDB then saw a placeholder with no value and refused:

    Invalid Input Error: Values were not provided for the following prepared
    statement parameters: 1

which is a bind failure caused by a contract the application advertised and
did not honour. Both halves are fixed here: parameters reach the engine, and
the bind is proven at validation time so the announcement is true.

Why EXPLAIN
-----------
`EXPLAIN` runs the parser, the binder and the optimizer and produces a plan.
It resolves every relation, column, alias, function, GROUP BY position and
ORDER BY term, and it executes nothing — an EXPLAIN of an unguarded
cross join over the whole book returns in about three milliseconds. It is a
real proof of bindability at no analytical cost, which is what section 6 asks
for.

What this module will never do
------------------------------
Repair. A bind failure returns the exact sanitized DuckDB diagnostic — the
exception type and the binder's own message — to the analyst, which is the
only repair mechanism V4 has.
