"""
What deserves attention in a book, decided the same way every time.

Deterministic, and zero model calls
-----------------------------------
This runs when a landing page loads. A page that costs a generation to
render is a page nobody can leave open, and a ranking that changes between
two loads of the same data is a ranking nobody can act on. So every number
here comes out of SQL over the pinned release and the ordering is a pure
function of those numbers.

Why it is domain-aware rather than domain-agnostic
--------------------------------------------------
A corporate book is watched by SECTOR: a sector's Stage 2 migration, its ECL
movement, its rating drift, its covenant headroom. A retail book is watched
by PRODUCT, SCORE BAND, DELINQUENCY BUCKET and VINTAGE, because the
individual account only matters once one of those moves. Pretending the two
are the same shape -- "segments" with "metrics" -- would produce a retail
page that talks about sectors it does not have.

So each domain declares its own families. The RANKING is shared, because
"material and moving" means the same thing in both books; what is ranked is
not.

Materiality and movement, together
----------------------------------
A segment that doubled its ECL on two accounts is noise. A segment holding a
fifth of the book that moved two per cent is not. The score multiplies a
normalised movement by the segment's share of the book, so neither alone
gets to the top, and a segment too small to matter is dropped before scoring
rather than ranked and buried.
