"""
What this runtime can actually do, in one place, truthfully.

The defect this exists for
--------------------------
A Mac runtime was started with the Saudi release unpublished. Preflight said
so:

    V4 preflight incomplete: DATA_UNAVAILABLE:
    release 'v4-saudi-20q-v1' is not published in this runtime.

and then the server started anyway, `GET /health` answered 200, the browser
posted a run, the API answered `202 Accepted`, and the run sat at "Request
accepted" for the rest of the afternoon. The attention endpoint answered a
raw 500 with an AttributeError in it.

All four came from one decision. When preflight failed, the application
substituted a placeholder object that carried a config and nothing else, and
handed it to the routes as the runtime. Every consumer then had a runtime --
so nothing refused anything. The routes called a method the real runtime has
and the placeholder did not; run creation had no reason to object; and the
worker was never started, because THAT check looked at the real runtime and
correctly saw none.

A stand-in that is present but cannot work is worse than an absence. An
absence is checkable.

So there is no stand-in. The runtime is the real one or it is `None`, and
this module answers, for a given runtime and config, which capabilities are
genuinely available. Every route that needs one asks here first, and a
capability that is not ready produces a TYPED refusal naming what is missing
and how to fix it -- never a 202 for work nothing will do, and never a
traceback.

Capability separation
---------------------
These are separate on purpose. Product Help answers from the product's own
knowledge and needs a model, not a portfolio. SQL analysis needs the release
open. Python analysis needs an isolated runner as well. The attention
dashboard needs the release and nothing else. A build missing one of them
should say which, rather than showing one green badge and failing at the
first question that happens to need the missing piece.
