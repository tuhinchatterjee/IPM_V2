"""
Product knowledge: a small synopsis always, the detail on request.

Why not attach the pack
-----------------------
The reviewed pack is ~9,000 tokens. Attaching it to every question would put
the entire product deck in front of a request about Stage 2 exposure, which is
the V3 mistake in a new costume: paying for the whole domain because the
question mentioned the product's name.

So two layers:

  * a compact SYNOPSIS in the starting context — positioning, the seven
    modules in one line each, the arc, and the boundaries. Enough to answer
    "Who are you?" or "What is CreditProbe?" well, in ONE generation.

  * `inspect_product_knowledge`, which returns the sections a specific
    question needs — TAC, the four layers, one module in full, or how two
    modules differ.

CreditProbe retrieves. Opus writes. Nothing here turns a retrieved section
into a canned answer: the sections are facts with slide provenance, and the
analyst decides what to say with them.
