"""
The V4 configuration contract, read from the environment and validated.

Why V4 reads the environment itself rather than extending `backend.config`
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
`backend/config.py` is shared by every module in the product. A V4 setting
added there is a setting every other runtime parses on startup, and the whole
point of this build is that V4 cannot disturb V3, EWS, What-if or anything
else that is running. So V4 owns its own names, all prefixed `COCKPIT_V4_`,
and reads them here.

Nothing in this module invents a value that would cost money or grant access.
Paths and unused ports get documented safe defaults, because a wrong path is
an inconvenience. A model id, a price, a key, a tenant, a release id and a
permission have NO default at all: a runtime that cannot say which model it
pays for does not get to guess, and `validate()` reports it as missing.

#: What a DATA_ANALYSIS run gets once the analyst declares one.
#:
#: The live evidence: a Standard analytical run hit the 60-second deadline
#: while the model was still writing SQL, and another stopped at COST_LIMIT
#: with about $0.71 committed because a further ~$0.30 response reservation
#: did not fit under $1.00. Neither bound was wrong for a product question;
#: both were wrong for an analysis that reads metadata, writes a query,
#: repairs it and then writes an answer.
#:
#: The cost figures are derived rather than chosen. At the verified Opus price
#: card ($15 / Mtok input, $75 / Mtok output), one analytical generation with
#: a ~12k-token assembled request and a 4,096-token response costs about
#: $0.18 + $0.31 = $0.49 worst case. A realistic analysis is metadata,
#: submission, one repair and a finalization -- four generations -- so about
#: $1.96 worst case and well under that in practice once responses settle at
#: actual usage. $1.50 covers the common three-generation path with the
#: reservation headroom the ledger needs; Deep's $3.00 covers the four-
#: generation path with a repair.
#: 120 seconds was measured against a run that writes ONE query and ONE
#: answer. Two live runs on a real book spent 25s, 21s and 52s on three
#: generations -- reading the question, authoring a repaired submission, and
#: writing the answer -- before the answer correction had even started, and
#: both were reaped mid-sentence. The failure mode was the defect and is
#: fixed elsewhere in this change: the run now settles cooperatively and
#: publishes its rows. This is the other half. A question that needs a
#: repair and a correction is an ordinary analytical question, not an abuse
#: of the allowance, and 180 seconds is what one costs.
#:
#: The cost ceiling is unchanged. Time was the bound that bit; spend was
#: nowhere near $1.50 in either run, and raising a ceiling nothing reached
#: would only weaken it.
