"""
The ledger: counters, cost reservations, and the run deadline.

The property this module has to have
------------------------------------
Every loop in the orchestration consumes something here that is never
replenished. Not "should consume" -- `spend_generation`, `spend_submission`,
`open_round`, `spend_format_recovery` and `spend_answer_correction` all raise
`BudgetExceeded` at zero, and the orchestrator has no path back to the model
that does not call one of them.

Cost is reserved BEFORE a paid attempt and settled after, at the verified
price. A cancelled or disconnected call settles as UNCERTAIN and its
reservation is held pending, because the provider may still have billed it.
Booking that as zero is how a run reports $0.00 having spent real money.
