"""
Assembly and preflight: what must be true before a run may cost anything.

Order matters here. Credential, model, capability and price are checked
BEFORE the release is opened, and the release is opened before any context is
built, and context is built before the first generation is dispatched. A run
that fails at any of those stages fails with the check's own name -- so an
operator is sent to the setting that is actually wrong, rather than to a
generic provider error three stages later.

Nothing in this module answers a question. If a check fails, the run stops
with that reason; there is no deterministic substitute and no V3 fallback.
