"""How long this turn is allowed to take, decided BEFORE the first call.

The defect this exists for
--------------------------
A live thread, seeded from an attention card, had already run one analysis.
The reader asked a second question:

    "How is risk building in Information Technology?"

The run failed with DEADLINE_EXPIRED at sixty seconds. Sixty is the PRODUCT
HELP allowance. The analysis allowance is a hundred and twenty, and the run
never reached it, because the widening happened only after the analyst had
declared `DATA_ANALYSIS` -- which takes a provider generation, which on a
large book is most of a minute. The turn was killed by the clock it was
supposed to have left behind before it started.

Widening on the declaration is right and stays. What was missing is that the
declaration is not the first thing that is knowable about a turn. A thread
opened from an attention card is about a number. A thread whose last turn ran
SQL is about a number. A question naming a measure and a sector is about a
number. None of that needs a model.

What this does
--------------
It reads the question, the thread it was asked in and the mode the reader
chose, and names ONE policy family before anything is spent:

    product_help.standard    60s   $1.00
    data_analysis.standard  120s   $1.50
    data_analysis.deep      240s   $3.00

The classification is deliberately asymmetric. Starting an analytical turn on
the help allowance kills it; starting a help turn on the analysis allowance
costs nothing, because an allowance is a CEILING and a Product Help answer
that takes eight seconds still takes eight seconds. So where the evidence
points both ways, this says analysis.

It never narrows. `Ledger.adopt` only ever widens, and the declaration path
in `orchestration` is unchanged: a turn this module reads as help, whose
analyst then declares an analysis, still widens on the declaration exactly as
before. This only removes the case where that widening arrives too late.
