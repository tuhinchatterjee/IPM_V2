"""
Answer validation: check the evidence, render the numbers, rewrite nothing.

What "validated" means here, precisely
--------------------------------------
Every `numeric_claim` is checked against the evidence this run produced, in
one of two ways.

A DIRECT claim names an artifact, a row and a column, and its value must
match what is stored there.

A DERIVED claim names an operation and the cells it consumes, and the value
is RECOMPUTED here from the stored artifact. This is the stricter of the two:
a direct claim is compared against a cell, a derived claim has its whole
arithmetic redone. It exists because a total across twelve sectors, or the
share carried by the largest four, is a real number with no row of its own --
and a validator that only accepted pointers to physical cells left the
analyst no move except inventing a row called "all sectors", which is exactly
what a live run did before being refused twice. The narrative's PROSE is not claimed to be
semantically verified -- no validator reads English and certifies that a
sentence is true. What is enforced is narrower and honest: a portfolio number
in the narrative must arrive through a `{{claim.id}}` placeholder bound to
evidence, so a figure cannot appear in the answer without an execution behind
it.

The renderer substitutes validated values at the declared unit and precision.
That is deterministic formatting of an evidence-bound value, which is
presentation. It is the ONLY transformation applied to the analyst's words.

        The defect this exists for
        --------------------------
        A live run executed its query, stored three result artifacts, and
        then could not write the answer about them. The reader was shown
        "This request stopped. Reason: ANSWER_FORMAT_EXHAUSTED" and nothing
        else -- no rows, no export, and on a refresh no record that the
        exchange had happened at all.

        The rows were never lost. They were in the artifact store the whole
        time, individually serveable, with their ids known to the
        orchestrator. What they did not have was an ADDRESS: the only
        channel a result can reach a reader through is the written answer
        object, and failing to produce that object is exactly what had
        happened.

        So this builds the object from the stored artifacts instead, with a
        server-written caveat in place of the narrative and NO numeric
        claims -- a claim is a thing the analyst asserted and had checked,
        and there is no analyst here to assert one. Every number comes from
        `render_tables`, which reads the artifact and formats it under the
        one display policy, so nothing published this way has passed
        through a model.

        THE CHARTS SURVIVE, when there are any. `rejected` is the answer
        that failed, and this used not to receive it at all: the parameter
        was absent, `charts` was a hard-coded `[]`, and a reader whose
        narrative was refused lost every picture the analyst had drawn
        along with it. Four live answers came back as bare tables that way,
        one of them after the reader had asked for a line chart by name.

        A chart is safe to keep where a claim is not. `_check_chart` judges
        a chart against its ARTIFACT -- the columns exist, the kind is
        known, the shape is readable -- and never against the narrative, so
        a chart that passed is still passing. `render_charts` then reads
        every value back out of the artifact store. Nothing the model wrote
        reaches the reader through this path; the drawing is the analyst's
        choice of WHICH stored rows to show, which is the same kind of
        choice the tables already carry.

        Returns `{}` when there is nothing to publish, which is the correct
        answer for a run that never executed anything.

        ONE POINT is not a comparison. A single scalar drawn as one bar tells
        a reader nothing they did not read in the sentence above it.

        TOO MANY POINTS is not a comparison either. Twelve sectors ranked by
        exposure is a chart; ninety borrowers with their covenant status is a
        list, and drawing it produces a wall of bars nobody reads and a
        label column nobody can align. This is the live case in §29 -- a
        "show me the customers behind this" answer arrived with a bar per
        borrower, which is a worse way to read the same table.

        the column names, or from the grain. A top-ten borrower ranking is
        ten points and passes, because ten points IS a readable comparison
        whatever the rows are called.

        WHAT COUNTS AS A POINT DEPENDS ON THE FORM. For a bar or a line it
        is a distinct x value, and the arithmetic above is right. For a
        MATRIX it is not: a rating migration over seven grades is forty-nine
