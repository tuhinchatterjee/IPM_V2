"""Which action the run is ALLOWED to take next, and who decides.

The division of labour
----------------------
CreditProbe knows the orchestration STATE: whether metadata is resolved,
whether a result exists, which book is open. Opus owns the analytical
CONTENT: which measure, which aggregation, which filters, which comparison,
what the numbers mean.

Those were mixed. Every action turn was offered every tool and asked to
choose among them -- including tools that could not legally do anything in
the state the run was actually in. A run with nothing executed was offered
`finalize_response`; a run whose governed metadata was fully resolved was
offered `inspect_catalog`; an analytical run was offered product knowledge.

The live failure that made this unavoidable
-------------------------------------------
run-62282e6be0ca48c5a4afdd3c468e3de8, "What is driving Stage 2 and ECL
growth?", Corporate, 120-second allowance:

    0.137s  first action generation starts
   28.303s  rejected: output_truncated -- no complete tool call
   28.3xx   recovery generation starts, WITH A BROADER TOOL SURFACE
            ("Product knowledge lookup available.")
   55.918s  failed: the one re-ask for a complete action was spent

2 of 12 generations. 0 of 5 executions. 0 of 4 catalogue calls. $0.34 of
$1.50. 64 seconds left. Nothing was exhausted except the re-ask, and the
re-ask was spent asking a harder question than the one that had just
failed.

`tool_choice: {"type": "any"}` was not enough. It requires SOME tool call;
it does not narrow WHAT the turn has to consider. With five tools on the
table and an answer contract among them, "any" still means "read all of
this, then decide" -- and the deciding is what ran out of output.

What this module does, and does not
-----------------------------------
It decides which tools are on the request and which one the provider is
told to call. It decides nothing about the analysis: not the relation, not
the measure, not the aggregation, not the periods, not the filters, not the
interpretation. `execute_analysis` is required in a state where executing
is the only legal transition -- WHAT to execute is entirely the analyst's,
and there is no code here that writes SQL.
