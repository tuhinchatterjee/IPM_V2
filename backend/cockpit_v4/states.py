"""
The explicit V4 state machine: top-level states, terminal outcomes, codes.

Two things kept deliberately separate
-------------------------------------
The STATE says where the run is. The ERROR CODE says what stopped it. V3
conflated them, so `STOPPED_OUTPUT_LIMIT` was both, and a UI that wanted to
render "did this succeed?" had to know every stop reason. Here `FAILED` is one
state and `OUTPUT_LIMIT` is one of the reasons a run can be in it, and the
mapping from V3's terminal envelopes is explicit in `V3_TERMINAL_MAP` so the
older UI keeps working without anyone reinterpreting a stop as a success.

Boundedness is a property of the edges, not of discipline: every edge that
returns to CONTEXT_READY consumes a generation attempt, an execution
submission, a format allowance, a correction allowance or elapsed time, and
none of those is replenished. `tests/cockpit_v4/test_state_machine.py` reads
this table and proves every cycle is finite.
