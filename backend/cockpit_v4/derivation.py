"""
Validating arithmetic that is real but has no row of its own.

The defect this exists for
--------------------------
A live run asked for exposure at default by sector. Everything worked: the
request was understood, EAD resolved to `ead_reported`, the latest quarter
resolved from the calendar, the SQL bound, it executed, twelve rows came
back. Then publication was refused, twice:

    claim 'total_ead' names row 'all sectors', which is not in artifact ...
    claim 'top4_pct' names row 'top 4 sectors', which is not in artifact ...

The analyst had done nothing wrong. A total across twelve sectors is a real
number a credit officer needs, and so is the share carried by the largest
four -- but neither is a cell in the result, because the query grouped by
sector and did not also produce a total row. Faced with a validator that
would only accept a pointer to one physical cell, the only move left was to
invent a row name, and inventing it is what got the answer rejected.

The fix is not to trust the analyst's arithmetic. It is to let a claim SHOW
its arithmetic, over cells that really exist, and to recompute it here.

What this is not
----------------
Not an expression language. There is no parser, no `eval`, no Python in the
payload and no way to write a new operation. A derivation names one operation
from a closed set, and each operation knows its own arity and how it consumes
its operands. Everything a claim can say is one of the twelve shapes below,
and anything else is refused by name.

Nesting is bounded at exactly one level -- an operation over operands, where
an operand is a set of cells in one column of one artifact. That is enough
for every derived figure a Cockpit answer has needed (a total, a share, a
movement, a growth rate, a weighted average, a rank), and it keeps the
schema finite, which matters because the provider's tool dialect rejects the
recursive constructs a deeper tree would need.

Exactness
---------
Every value is `Decimal`, parsed from the artifact's own stored string form.
Floats are not used anywhere in this module: a book total that reads
20720.343518249818 in one place and 20720.34351824982 in another is a
reconciliation argument nobody should have to have.
