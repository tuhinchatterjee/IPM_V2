"""
Everything ONE analytical run needs, resolved from that run's own book.

The defect this module exists for
---------------------------------
`worker._drive` opened its SQL session from `self.runtime.catalog` -- one
process-wide catalogue, built from one pinned release at startup. Every run in
the process shared it, so a run's domain could be recorded on its thread, its
dashboard could be computed correctly, its badge could say Retail, and the
analysis would still read corporate relations. Nothing in the answer would
have said so.

The previous round refused retail runs rather than let that happen. This
module is what makes the refusal unnecessary: the analytical runtime is
derived from the RUN, not from the process.

Where the identity comes from
-----------------------------
The persisted run and its thread, and nowhere else. Not the frontend, not the
Home switch as it currently stands, not a startup default, and not whichever
catalogue happened to be cached first. A run settled three minutes after the
reader switched the page to the other book must still read the book it was
asked in.

Caching
-------
Keyed by tenant, domain, release AND fingerprint. A release id is a name; two
builds share it and hold different numbers, so a cache keyed on the name would
serve the old build's catalogue to the new build's question.
