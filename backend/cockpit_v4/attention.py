"""
The Cockpit home feed: what deteriorated in the recorded book, and why.

What this is
------------
A deterministic analytical dashboard. It reads the pinned Cockpit V4 release
through the same read-only DuckDB session an analysis uses, computes a fixed
set of indicators at sector x quarter grain, scores them by a published
formula, and returns the top few with the numbers behind them.

What it is NOT
--------------
It is not Early Warning. Every indicator here is a movement in the RECORDED
book between two reporting quarters. Nothing live, nothing behavioural,
nothing predictive, and no EWS score is read, imported or imitated. The
Cockpit question is "what deteriorated in what we have recorded"; the Early
Warning question is "what is starting to go wrong now", and that belongs to
Early Warning.

It is also not a model call. No paid generation happens to render the home
page — not for the ranking, not for the headline, not for the explanation.
The model enters only when the user presses Investigate Further, and then it
is an ordinary V4 run with the item as its starting context.

The ranking, in full
--------------------
For each sector and each indicator, at the latest populated quarter Q, against
two comparison bases: the prior quarter, and the same quarter one year
earlier.

  1. value_old, value_new are computed from aggregates. A null on either side
     is NOT zero: the candidate is dropped and the reason recorded.
  2. adverse_delta = (value_new - value_old) * direction, where direction is
     +1 for indicators where up is worse and -1 where down is worse.
     adverse_delta <= 0 means no deterioration; the candidate is dropped.
  3. exposure_at_risk translates the movement into money, so a share, a ratio
     and an amount can be compared:
       - share/ratio indicators: adverse_delta * sector EAD at Q
       - amount indicators:      adverse_delta itself
  4. Materiality gates, all relative to the book so they travel to a bigger
     portfolio without being re-tuned:
       - exposure_at_risk  >= 5 bps of book EAD
       - sector EAD        >= 50 bps of book EAD in BOTH periods
       - facility count    >= 2 in both periods
     A sector that fails a gate is dropped with the gate named. This is what
     stops a two-facility sector producing a 100% "spike" off a tiny base.
  5. score = 100 * (0.5 * relative + 0.5 * money) * confidence
       relative   = min(1, adverse_delta / indicator.full_move)
       money      = min(1, exposure_at_risk / (2% of book EAD))
       confidence = min(1, min(facilities_old, facilities_new) / 5)
  6. De-duplication, so five cards are five issues:
       - one candidate per (sector, indicator family): the highest score wins,
         which is why "ECL up", "ECL coverage up" and "ECL outgrew exposure"
         cannot occupy three of the five slots for one sector;
       - then a round-robin over sectors, so five DIFFERENT sectors appear
         before any sector takes a second slot.
  7. Ties break on: score, then exposure_at_risk, then adverse_delta, then
     sector name, then indicator id. Every step is total and reproducible.

Fewer than five qualifying items is a legitimate outcome and is reported as
such. Padding the list with movements that failed a materiality gate would
make the feed worse than empty.
