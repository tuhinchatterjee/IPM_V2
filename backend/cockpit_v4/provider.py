"""
The provider boundary: one explicit model, native tool calls, real deadlines.

What this module refuses to do
------------------------------
It does not choose a model. `AI_COCKPIT_REASONING_MODEL` names one id, it is
verified against the provider, and if it is missing or will not serve, the run
fails with a configuration error. There is no "latest", no inheriting
`AI_MODEL`, no substituting a cheaper model when the named one is unavailable,
and no second model to fall back to on a refusal.

It also does not extract JSON from prose. A tool call arrives as a complete
tool_use block or it does not arrive; a regex over a half-written sentence is
how a truncated plan becomes an executed query.

Deadlines are enforced OUTSIDE the client. An HTTP read timeout bounds one
socket read, not an end-to-end run, and an SDK that retries internally can
turn a 30-second timeout into three minutes. SDK retries are switched off here
so every actual HTTP attempt passes through the ledger.
