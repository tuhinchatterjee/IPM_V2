"""
Which book a question is about. Not a setting, and not a frontend filter.

The defect this module exists for
---------------------------------
`DOMAIN = "corporate_cockpit"` was a module constant, and the runtime pinned
one release with a process-wide catalogue cache. There was exactly one book
per process, so "Corporate or Retail?" had nowhere to live except a label on
a screen -- and a label is not isolation. A Retail question would have read
Corporate relations and nothing in the answer would have said so.

A domain here is a whole analytical world: its own release, its own
fingerprint, its own relations and fields, its own calendar, its own
attention methodology. Two domains never share a catalogue entry, a session,
a cache line or an artifact, and the thing that guarantees it is that every
one of those is keyed by the domain rather than checked against it.

What a domain is NOT
--------------------
It is not a tenant. Two tenants are two customers of the same book; two
domains are two books. It is not a release either: a release is one immutable
build OF a domain, and a domain outlives its releases.

    **Off by default.** Both flags default off, so this returns exactly
    `DEFAULT_RELEASES[domain_id]` and the accepted application opens the
    accepted book. Changing the default source silently is the one thing this
    must not do.

    **Visible when on.** The candidate has its OWN release id and its own
    fingerprint -- not a rebuild under a frozen name. Everything downstream
    already keys on both (`DomainScope.cache_key`, the thread's pinned
    release, `artifacts.comparison_evidence`), so a source change invalidates
    a cohort binding and a scenario confirmation rather than quietly serving
    different numbers under the same heading.

    **Falls back rather than failing.** A flag on with nothing published is an
    operator halfway through setting the candidate up, not a reason to refuse
    a book that is sitting right there. `flags.status()` is where the
