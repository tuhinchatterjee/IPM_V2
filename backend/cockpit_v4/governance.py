"""How a question became a number, assembled from what was already stored.

The gap this fills
------------------
A reader pressed "Trace" and got the process panel: a list of stages with
ticks against them. It said the analysis had run. It did not say what was
understood from the question, which governed values the reader's own words
resolved to, what query was written, whether a query was refused, which
relations were read, or how the figure in the second paragraph reached the
page from the row it came out of.

Every one of those was ALREADY ON FILE. The exact SQL of every submission,
byte for byte, including the ones the binder refused and which therefore
never ran. The bind proof and the checks each step passed. The intent
envelope with its resolved entities and open questions. The row id of
every table cell and every chart point. The release id and the fingerprint
of the bytes. None of it had a route.

So this module reads, and does not compute. It opens no model, runs no
query and recalculates no figure; it assembles stored records into the
order a person reads them.

What it will not do
-------------------
Claim row-level provenance it does not have. Lineage here stops at the
result set: an artifact row can be traced to the step and the query that
produced it, and NOT to the source rows that were aggregated into it. The
record says so at that boundary, in the payload, rather than laying out a
waterfall that implies a link nobody can follow.

Who may see the SQL
-------------------
The query is the bank's logic. It is shown to an administrator and
withheld from everyone else -- with the step, its purpose, its checks and
its outcome all still shown, because the point of a governance record is
that a reader can see the controls worked without being handed the
internals.
