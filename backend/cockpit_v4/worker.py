"""
The worker: claims a run, builds its services, drives it, settles it.

The lease is the point. A worker holds a lease with a fence number and
heartbeats every two seconds; the supervisor settles a run whose lease went
stale. A worker that comes back after being fenced cannot overwrite the
settled outcome, because every state write is a compare-and-swap on the run's
version and the store refuses a stale writer.

On worker loss the run becomes INTERRUPTED with its current operation and its
preserved artifacts. It is NOT replayed automatically: an uncertain paid
provider call or an executable batch may have already happened, and replaying
it spends money twice and can double-count an execution submission.
