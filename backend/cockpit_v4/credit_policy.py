"""
The bank's credit policy: a synopsis always, the clauses on request.

Why not attach the policy
-------------------------
The pack is thirty clauses across two books, about 23KB of JSON. Attaching
it to every question would put the whole rule book in front of a request
about Stage 2 exposure -- the same mistake `product_knowledge` exists to
avoid, in a different costume. So two layers:

  * a compact SYNOPSIS -- which book's policy is in force, its sections,
    and the handful of thresholds a portfolio question actually collides
    with (the concentration limits, the DBR caps, the SICR triggers, the
    write-off points). Enough to notice that a number has crossed a line.

  * `retrieve`, which returns the clauses a specific question needs, in
    full, with their thresholds and the levers they offer.

Both are carried on the ANSWER turn, by `context.finalization_system`. Not
on an action turn, which holds no number yet and so has nothing to compare
against a threshold; and not through a tool.

WHY NOT A TOOL. It was one first, and the tool could not be called. The
state that holds a result REQUIRES `finalize_response`, so a tool offered
beside it is a schema every action turn pays for and no turn can reach.
Retrieval here needs no judgement either -- the clause ids and the topics
are in the reader's own words, exactly as `values.resolve` reads a category
value -- so the server does it and the analyst cannot fail to have asked.

THE BOOKS DO NOT CROSS. A Retail thread never receives a Corporate clause
and a Corporate thread never receives a Retail one, because a policy
recommendation quoting the wrong book's rule is worse than no
recommendation: it is a governance answer that sounds right.

What this is for
----------------
A finding is not an action. "Credit Card - Gold held by non-salaried
customers is entering arrears at 20-29 days" is a fact about the book; what
a credit committee needs next is which rule allowed it and what changing
that rule would do. That step is only safe if the rule is QUOTED rather
than remembered, which is why `recommendation` below refuses a policy
action that cites no clause -- the same discipline as a numeric claim with
no evidence behind it.

CreditProbe retrieves. The analyst decides. Nothing here writes a
recommendation or ranks one clause above another.
