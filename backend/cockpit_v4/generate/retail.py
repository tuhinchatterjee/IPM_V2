"""
A Saudi retail credit book, twenty months of it, at a real retail grain.

Retail is not corporate with different words
--------------------------------------------
A corporate facility is one large exposure to one obligor, watched
individually. A retail account is one of thousands, watched as a population:
what matters is how a PRODUCT, a SCORE BAND, a DELINQUENCY BUCKET or a
VINTAGE is moving, and the individual account matters when it falls out of
one of those. So the grain here is customer x account x month, the
behavioural score and the variables behind it are first-class, and the
segmentation is product and score band rather than sector.

The authored stories
--------------------
Credit Card utilisation and delinquency build through the window while
Mortgage stays sound; the 2024 Personal Finance vintage deteriorates well
ahead of the 2025 one; score band D thins as its accounts fall into E; and a
cohort of Auto Finance accounts cures and improves. Not everything worsens,
because a book where it does teaches an analyst nothing about telling signal
from level.

#: What the composite pressure is worth in absolute terms.
#:
#: Tuned against the book it produces, not chosen first. At 1.0 the stressed
#: products came out with ninety-seven per cent of card accounts in Stage 2 --

#: every question asked of it would have a silly answer. The deterioration is
#: meant to be findable, not total.
STRESS_SCALE = 0.27

#: Monthly probability that a CURRENT account misses a payment, before the
#: account's own fragility and the product's stress are applied.
#:
#: Delinquency is not a threshold on a smooth stress index. Modelled that
#: way -- which is how this generator began -- the worst account in the book
#: reached eighty days past due and SEVEN accounts out of twelve thousand
#: ever defaulted, because a smooth index has no tail. A retail book without
#: a tail has no non-performing population, so every question about arrears,
#: Stage 3, write-offs, cures or coverage answers "approximately nothing" and
#: means nothing.
#:
#: So arrears are a ROLL-RATE process: an account enters at a hazard, then
#: each month either cures or rolls thirty days deeper, and one deep enough
#: is charged off and leaves the book. Stress raises the entry hazard and
#: slows the cure; it does not decide the outcome.

# ---- the planted patterns ------------------------------------------------
#
# Everything above shapes the book as a whole. What follows is deliberate
# STRUCTURE inside it: six findings a credit team would be expected to
# reach, each reachable by a different cut, and each with a wrong answer
# sitting next to the right one. A book that only trends teaches an analyst
# nothing about telling a segment from a mix or a season from a slide.
#
# Every one of them is recovered by a direct SQL oracle in
# `tests/cockpit_v4/domain_oracles.py`, so a tuning change that quietly
# buries one fails a test rather than being discovered in a demonstration.

#: R2. The corner of the card book that is actually moving.
#:
#: Credit Card - Gold held by Non-salaried customers, from 2026-01. The
#: product total barely moves, because Classic is two-thirds of it and
#: Classic is flat; the answer is only visible at product x sub-product x
#: employment type. Entries land in 20-29 first and reach 30-59 two months
#: later, so a reader who stops at the `1-29` bucket sees a small rise and a
#: reader who splits it sees where the rise is.

#: R6. One region, one sub-product. Used-vehicle Auto Finance in Qassim,
#: from 2025-11. Auto Finance is the book's IMPROVING product, so a reader

REGION_POCKET_MULTIPLE = 5.2

#: R4. A vintage, not a calendar month. Accounts written in the last quarter
#: of 2025 underperform at EQUAL months on book -- a cut-off that was moved
#: and moved back. In calendar time they are indistinguishable, because they
#: are young and a young account is current whatever was wrong with it.
BAD_VINTAGE_MONTHS = ("2025-10", "2025-11", "2025-12")
BAD_VINTAGE_HAZARD_MULTIPLE = 2.3

#: R5. Ramadan and Eid. Spending rises, a payment is missed, and it is made
#: up within two months. This is NOT deterioration and an analysis that
#: calls it deterioration is wrong, which is the point of including it.
#: Ramadan fell in March 2025 and February 2026 over this window.

SEASON_HAZARD_MULTIPLE = 2.1

SEASON_CURE_MULTIPLE = 1.9

#: R3. Simpson's paradox, planted rather than hoped for.
#:
#: Mortgage is the cleanest product in the book and it takes a growing share
#: of new accounts across the window, so a portfolio rate is being diluted
#: at the same time as every product's own rate rises. The tilt below does
#: that gently across all vintages; `MORTGAGE_CAMPAIGN_FROM` does it hard at
#: the end, where a reader is looking.
#:
#: The claim this supports is NOT that the book's arrears fall to nothing --
#: that would take a book nine-tenths mortgage, which is not a book. It is
#: the real and far commoner version: over the closing months the PORTFOLIO
#: delinquency rate is flat or falling while the rate inside EVERY product
#: is rising. "Is the book improving?" then has two defensible answers, only
#: one of them is right, and an analysis that reports the portfolio line
#: without the mix has given the wrong one.
MIX_SHIFT_PRODUCT = "Mortgage"
MIX_SHIFT_WEIGHT = 1.75

#: The campaign that does the diluting: clean mortgage accounts written in
#: volume over the closing months, as a share of the customer base. Real,

#: having changed.
MORTGAGE_CAMPAIGN_FROM = "2025-11"
