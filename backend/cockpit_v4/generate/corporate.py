"""
A Saudi corporate credit book, twenty QUARTERS of it, with things to find.

Why quarters
------------
A corporate credit file is reviewed on the cycle its obligors actually report
on. Audited and reviewed financials, internal rating actions, covenant tests
and the IFRS 9 stage that follows them all land quarterly; a monthly
corporate book invents twelve observations a year that no credit committee
ever saw. The retail book next door is monthly for the opposite reason:
retail risk is behavioural, and behaviour is a monthly signal.

So this book publishes `reporting_quarter`, its relations are named for it,
and nothing in it pretends a month is available.

What this is not
----------------
It is not noise. A synthetic book whose every metric wanders randomly is
useless for the thing it exists to support: an analyst asking "what is
deteriorating and why" and getting an answer that holds together. So the
dynamics here are authored -- a few sectors under real stress, a downgrade
cluster that shows up in ratings before it shows up in stage, covenant
headroom eroding where leverage is rising, collateral values softening in
one sector and firming in another -- and the rest of the book is stable or
quietly improving, because a portfolio where everything worsens at once is
its own kind of unbelievable.

Determinism
-----------
Every number comes from a seeded generator and a pure function of
(entity, quarter). Two builds of the same release id produce byte-identical
parquet and therefore the same fingerprint, which is what makes the
fingerprint worth checking.
