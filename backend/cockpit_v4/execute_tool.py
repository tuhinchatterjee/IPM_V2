"""
`execute_analysis`: validate exactly, execute exactly, repair never.

The single rule
---------------
The code that runs is byte-for-byte the code the analyst submitted. This
module parses an AST to decide whether to ALLOW it; the parse result is never
what executes. There is no path here that rewrites a filter, removes a join,
substitutes a column that looked close, drops a step to fit a bound, or
computes a business number itself. Every one of those turns a wrong analysis
into a confident one.

When something is wrong, this returns a failure packet naming the exact check
and the exact step, and the analyst writes the replacement. That is the only
repair mechanism V4 has.

Isolation is the actual security boundary, not the allowlists. The DuckDB
session holds ONE domain's relations, already filtered to tenant, release and
domain; it is built with file access enabled and then locked before any
submitted SQL is admitted (`catalog.open_session` does this). A step naming a
relation of the other book is refused by name, not served an empty table.
Python runs in a separate process jail or is reported UNAVAILABLE -- it is
never quietly evaluated in this process.
