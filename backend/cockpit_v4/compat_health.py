"""
The shell-compatible health route, and why V4 serves one at all.

The application shell polls `GET /api/v1/health` and renders "Backend offline"
when that call fails. Point the shell at the V4 API without this route and the
header reports the whole backend as down while V4 is answering every request
it was asked to answer -- which is not a cosmetic problem: it is the status
indicator lying, and a user who is told the backend is offline stops trusting
the answer next to it.

So V4 answers the same contract, truthfully, about itself.

The headline `status` is the worst of the V4 SERVICE components only. The
legacy dashboard surfaces this runtime deliberately does not serve are
reported as `not_configured` and are excluded from the headline, exactly as
`backend/api/routers/health.py` already excludes "no AI provider configured"
from its own: a mode the product supports is not a fault in the service.
Letting an absent optional surface turn the light red would reintroduce the
misreport by a different route.
