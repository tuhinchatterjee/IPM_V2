"""
Where the ECL is, and what moved it. Computed, never narrated.

Two questions, both asked of every book
---------------------------------------
1. THE PROFILE. How much exposure sits in each IFRS 9 stage this month, how
   much loss is carried against it, and what the coverage is. With the same
   figures for the month before, so the movement is a fact rather than an
   impression.

2. THE DECOMPOSITION. Total ECL moved by some amount between two months.
   This says how much of that move each identifiable cause contributed, and
   the causes sum to the move EXACTLY -- not approximately, and not with a
   residual quietly labelled "other".

The decomposition, stated so a reader can check it
--------------------------------------------------
Every exposure (a facility in the Corporate book, an account in Retail) is in
exactly one of three groups between the two months, so the groups partition
the change and cannot double-count it:

  NEW         present this month, absent last month      + ECL_now
  CLOSED      present last month, absent this month      - ECL_before
  RETAINED    present in both                            ECL_now - ECL_before

The retained group is then split, again exactly:

  STAGE MIGRATION    stage changed          the whole of its ECL change
  EXPOSURE CHANGE    stage unchanged        ΔEAD x coverage_before
  RISK CHANGE        stage unchanged        the remainder

"Risk change" is a remainder by construction and is labelled as one: it is
what is left after the exposure movement is taken out at last month's
coverage, which is PD, LGD and any overlay together. Splitting it further
would require model parameters this book does not publish, and inventing that
split is how a decomposition becomes a story.

Why it is not a model call
--------------------------
Every number here is an aggregate of published columns. A language model
cannot make it more accurate and can make it wrong, so the analyst is never
asked. The analyst's job starts where this ends: explaining a movement this
has already measured.
