"""
Which CATEGORY did the reader mean? Resolved without a model call.

Two different questions, and they were being answered by the same mechanism
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCHEMA RESOLUTION asks "which field?" — is it `product_type`, `facility_type`,
`product`? The catalogue answers that, and it is already good at it.

VALUE RESOLUTION asks "which category value?" — is "prject finance" the thing
the book calls `project_finance`? Nothing answered that, so a live run spent
generation after generation asking the catalogue for `product_name`,
`product_category`, `facility_type`, `product`, `product_code` — inventing
field names because the field it already had did not seem to contain the
value the user typed.

The reader does not know the book's underscores or its capitalisation. They
should not have to.

What this does
--------------
For every GOVERNED categorical field of low cardinality, it builds a bounded
index of the values that actually exist, keyed by a normalised form and by a
small set of authored aliases. Then:

  "project finance", "Project Finance", "project-finance", "PROJECT_FINANCE"
      → project_finance, exactly, with no fuzzy matching at all.

  "prject finance", "projet finance", "project finence"
      → project_finance, when the near match is UNIQUELY strong.

  "finance"
      → refused, with the close matches named, because it could be Project
        Finance, Personal Finance or Auto Finance and guessing between them
        is choosing the analysis.

What it deliberately does not do
--------------------------------
It does not resolve a value it is not sure about, it does not index a
high-cardinality field (there is no useful "did you mean" across four
thousand borrower names), and it never invents a value that is not in the
book. A resolution is recorded as a `canonical_mapping` and a
`resolved_assumption`, so the trace shows what was read and what it was taken
to mean.
