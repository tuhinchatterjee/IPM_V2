"""
`inspect_catalog`: exact authorized metadata, retrieved selectively.

The V3 behaviour this replaces
------------------------------
V3 attached the whole field dictionary -- 991 addressable relation.column
definitions, every ratio, the expanded macro pivot and a full missingness
table -- to every planning call, whatever the question was. "Who are you?"
paid for the entire corporate data domain.

V4 sends a compact INDEX in the starting context (relation names, one-line
grains, subject families, available quarters) and nothing else. When the
analyst needs a definition it asks for it, and this returns the COMPLETE
metadata for exactly what was asked: definition, unit, grain, aggregation
behaviour, valid joins, coverage and missingness. Selective does not mean
partial -- a field returned with half its definition is worse than one not
returned at all, because the analyst cannot tell it is missing something.

What this tool must never do: choose a field, infer what "exposure" means, or
answer with a plausible schema when the search found nothing. An empty search
is an empty search.
