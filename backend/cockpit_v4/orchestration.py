"""
The one analyst loop. A messenger with a ledger, not a second brain.

What this module does: assemble authorized context, dispatch one generation,
validate the action it asked for, run it, persist what happened, put the
result back, and repeat until the analyst finalizes or a bound stops it.

What this module must never do, and has no code for:
  * repair a query, a plan, a field reference or an answer;
  * compute a business number when execution failed;
  * fall back to V3, to a canned decomposition, or to another model;
  * claim an answer was delivered because it was generated.

Every loop back to `CONTEXT_READY` passes through a ledger call that consumes
something finite. There is no `continue` in this file that does not.
