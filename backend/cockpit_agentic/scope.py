"""
The domain boundary, below the model. Specification section 6.4.

Read-only alone is not a data-domain boundary
---------------------------------------------
Section 6.4 is explicit about this, and it is the sentence this module exists
to satisfy. A read-only connection to the whole warehouse would still let a
generated query name `ews_alerts`. What is needed is a principal that can see
ONLY the allowlisted Cockpit views, for one tenant, over one pinned release,
restricted "even if generated code names another schema, source table, catalog,
search service, cached artifact or exported file".

That is enforced in `sql.py` by building a connection whose entire universe is
ten views over one release's Parquet files, and then disabling file and network
access and locking the configuration so nothing the model writes can widen it.
This module decides WHAT that universe contains.

Metadata is scoped too
----------------------
`visible` filters a listing BEFORE it is described. A refusal says the same
thing whether a relation belongs to another module or does not exist, so the
refusal itself does not map the rest of the application.
