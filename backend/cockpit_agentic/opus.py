"""
Opus: ownership, planning, authorship, repair and review.
Specification sections 6, 7.5, 7.8, 8 and 13.

One conversation, not four calls
--------------------------------
The gate, the plan, every repair and the review are turns of ONE conversation.
That is not an optimisation: section 8.1 requires every repair continuation to
carry the full effective context, and threading the messages is how the
catalogue, the approved ownership decision and the plan stay present without
being re-serialized into each error. The assistant's own blocks go back
verbatim, in order, because that is what the provider requires and what makes
the continuation the same conversation rather than a new one.

Section 6.2 permits the first response to carry both the functionality decision
and a candidate plan, so long as the gate is logically first and CreditProbe
approves before anything executes. It does, and it is: `runtime` checks
`decision.may_execute` and issues a server-side permission before a single
statement reaches the engine, and a referral response is required to carry no
executable plan at all.

What is not here
----------------
No method vocabulary, no template, no canned analysis. The schemas describe the
SHAPE of a plan and a submission — subquestions, fields, steps, code — and say
nothing about what the analysis should be. `AnalysisPlan.method_summary` is
free text. That is the difference between a contract and the template this
architecture removes.

#: What one turn's user message costs, in characters, over and above the

#: 1,400 characters; 2,400 is that with headroom. It is a reservation rather
#: than a measurement, so it is named and `Conversation.counts` can be checked
#: against it after a run.
TURN_MESSAGE_CHARS = 2400

#: What to hold back, beyond the reply, for the turns AFTER the one being
#: sized. The analysis packet is built once and every later turn of the request
#: -- the review, each repair -- is appended to the same conversation, so a
#: packet sized to fill the cap exactly leaves the second turn nowhere to go.
#:
#: One further turn, measured at about 3,300 tokens: a repair turn carrying a
#: failure packet with its diagnostics and the results already obtained.
#:
#: Deliberately NOT the worst case, and this is a real trade-off rather than a
#: rounding. A review turn carrying a WIDE result -- a `SELECT *` over the
#: 198-column facility relation -- costs about 8,000, and four repairs cost
#: about 13,000; reserving for either would spend every rung of the reduction
#: ladder on every request, and in Standard mode would refuse the packet
#: outright, including for the great majority of questions that are answered
#: from their first submission. So the reserve buys the common case one further
#: turn, and where a wide result or a long repair sequence outgrows the cap
#: that is reported as CONTEXT_TOO_LARGE with the honest reason.
#: docs/cockpit_agentic_v3/CONTEXT_SIZING.md records how many turns each mode
#: affords and why Deep is the configuration that holds the full repair path.
