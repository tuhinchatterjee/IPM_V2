"""
The request budget ledger. Specification section 9.

Every guardrail lives here, and nowhere else. Prompting Opus to "try only five
times" is not enforcement; neither is a value object recomputed on each call,
which is what Cockpit V2's `budgets.py` was. This ledger is the single atomic
counter for one user request, it persists, and it refuses.

Three rules the shape of this module exists to make true
--------------------------------------------------------
**One counter, not a tree.** All execution submissions share ONE request
counter. Five total candidate submissions, not five per analysis round. A new
plan does not reset it; `note_submission` does not know or care which plan
asked.

**The earliest bound wins.** `reserve` checks every limit before every
provider call: calls, tokens, spend, deadline, and the per-call input and
output caps. A request may stop on the deadline at submission two and never
see attempt five. Five is a permission, not a promise.

**A reservation is taken before the call, not after.** Worst-case output
tokens and worst-case cost are held at dispatch and settled against actual
usage on return. A call that dies in flight has still consumed its
reservation, because the provider may well have served it.

Cost when price is unknown
--------------------------
When no price is configured the ledger reports spend as UNKNOWN and
`cost_enforced` is False. It does not invent an estimate and it does not claim
the cost ceiling is reliable — section 9.1 is explicit that an unconfigured
price means the limit is not a control.

    The UAT configuration, and what moved
    -------------------------------------
    The specification's own 12,000/20,000-token per-call input caps and its
    35,000/70,000-token cumulative ceilings cannot hold this domain's mandatory
    field catalogue, which measures about 22,000 tokens on its own. That was
    measured, documented in docs/cockpit_agentic_v3/CONTEXT_SIZING.md, and put
    to the owner rather than closed in code.

    The owner's decision, applied here as the UAT configuration:

    * Standard: 64,000-token input packet, 250,000-token cumulative ceiling.
    * Deep:     96,000-token input packet, 500,000-token cumulative ceiling.

    These are still application guardrails and still configurable. What did NOT
    move, and cannot:

    * five Opus-authored execution submissions;
    * three substantive analysis rounds;
    * the 60-second Standard and 120-second Deep deadlines;
    * the total model-call ceilings;
    * the spending ceilings, which stay where they were so live usage can be
      measured against them before anyone proposes new ones;
    * no automatic escalation from Standard to Deep;
    * the earliest bound wins.

    The finalization reserve grew with the ceiling for one reason: it has to be
    able to fund a terminal explanation that carries the same catalogue, and a
    6,000-token reserve could not.
