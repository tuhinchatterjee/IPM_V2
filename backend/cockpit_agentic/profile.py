"""
Field-level missingness, from the full authorized data. Specification section 5.

Not from ten preview rows
-------------------------
Section 5 is explicit that profiles are built from the actual authorized data,
and section 7.4-F that they come from here rather than from Sonnet or from the
sample rows. Ten rows cannot tell you that a field is 40% null, and a preview
that happens to show ten populated rows of a mostly-empty column is worse than
no preview: it invites a confident analysis of almost nothing.

Two denominators, kept apart
----------------------------
The overall missing fraction and the fraction missing among APPLICABLE rows are
different numbers whenever `not_applicable` occurs, and reporting only the
first makes a field look broken when it is merely inapplicable. Both are
published, and `compact` includes the second only when it differs.

A global rate must not conceal a quarter
----------------------------------------
A field 5% missing overall may be 100% missing in the quarter the user selected.
`by_quarter` carries the per-quarter rate and `compact` surfaces any quarter
that is entirely empty, because that is the case that silently ruins an answer.

Computed once per release, not per query.
