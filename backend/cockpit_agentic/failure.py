"""
The failure packet returned to Opus. Specification sections 7.6A and 8.

The rule this module exists to enforce
--------------------------------------
CreditProbe never repairs, rewrites, edits, patches, completes or substitutes
Opus-authored SQL or Python. This module is where that rule could most
plausibly be broken — it is the code that looks at a broken query and knows
what would fix it — and it does not break it.

`available_alternatives` reports fields that EXIST and are near the name that
did not. That is a catalogue fact. Which one is analytically right is not a
catalogue fact: `pd_pit_12m` and `pd_ttc_12m` are both real, and only the
question decides between them. So the packet offers both, with their meanings
and units, and says nothing about which to use. There is no code path here that
produces SQL.

What "full effective context" means
-----------------------------------
Section 8.1: a request id or a schema hash alone is NOT memory. Every repair
continuation carries the original question, the business request, the scope,
the complete catalogue, the coverage, the approved ownership decision, the
current plan, the exact failed code, the diagnostics, the results already
obtained, the approaches already tried, and the remaining budget.

The static half of that belongs ONCE in the assembled conversation, not
duplicated inside every error JSON — section 8.1 says so explicitly. So this
packet carries the failure and the deltas, and `context_attached` NAMES the
parts that must be present in the outbound request. `runtime` asserts each
named part is genuinely there before dispatching, and a test reads the
serialized request to prove it.

# its own compliance. So the assembled request is read here, immediately before
# it is dispatched, and a missing item stops the request.

# dictionary, the failed code itself. A reference, an id or a hash does not
# satisfy any of them -- which is the point.
