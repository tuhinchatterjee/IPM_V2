"""Isolated Python execution for Opus-authored analysis steps.

What this module is
-------------------
Some analysis is not a SELECT. A survival curve, a decomposition across
several result sets, a regression against the macro window -- these are
computations over rows already fetched, and the specification allows Opus to
author Python for them. This module is the boundary that makes running that
code acceptable, and nothing more. It does not write Python, read Python for
intent, or repair Python. `CreditProbe` remains validator, executor,
diagnostician and guardrail enforcer, and the diagnostic it returns on failure
goes to Opus unedited.

The guarantee, and how it is obtained
-------------------------------------
The code never runs in the API process. It runs in a separate process placed
in fresh mount, network, PID, IPC and UTS namespaces, chrooted into a tmpfs
jail containing the interpreter, an explicitly approved dependency surface, a
read-only copy of its inputs and a writable output directory -- and nothing
else. There is no /etc, no repository, no environment file, no socket to any
network, no shell on PATH that reaches anything, and no writable path outside
the workspace. Address space, CPU seconds, file size, process count and core
dumps are bounded. Privileges are dropped before the code runs.

Why the availability flag is measured, not assumed
--------------------------------------------------
`probe()` does not look for `/usr/bin/unshare` and conclude that isolation
works. It runs a real job in a real jail whose code TRIES to escape -- opens a
socket to a routable address, opens /etc/passwd, writes to /usr, looks for the
repository, reads the environment for anything that smells like a credential,
checks its own uid -- and reports what happened. Python execution is offered
only when every one of those attempts failed in the expected way.

If the probe does not pass, `available` is False, the reason is recorded, and
the runtime tells Opus that Python is unavailable. There is no in-process
fallback, no restricted `eval`, no AST allowlist standing in for a kernel
boundary. The alternative to isolation here is not running.
