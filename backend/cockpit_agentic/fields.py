"""
The complete authorized field dictionary. Specification section 4.

Every field Cockpit may read is declared here, once, with its units, type,
definition, aggregation behaviour and availability. Nothing outside this module
is exposed: the allowlist is the dictionary, so a source column added later is
NOT automatically reachable through a `SELECT *` view (section 3.4).

Three rules this module makes structural
----------------------------------------
**Per-type and per-horizon names are expanded here, not templated.** Section
4.9 requires twelve collateral types x nine summary columns to reach Opus as
108 real column names, and `CockpitFieldSpec` refuses a name containing a
brace. `collateral_summary_fields()` does the expansion; nothing downstream
sees `{type}`.

**Definitions are semantics, not templates.** The forty ratio definitions in
section 4.6 say what a stored or derived number MEANS. They are not a
compulsory analysis Opus must imitate, and no code in this package consumes
them as a formula to run.

**Null is not zero, and schema existence is not population.** Every field
carries an `availability` and, where relevant, a `missing_reason`. A field
present in the schema but unsupplied by a source stays `unavailable`.
