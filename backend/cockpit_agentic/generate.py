"""
The twenty-quarter synthetic demonstration release. Specification section 5.

Deterministic from one master seed. Nothing here describes a real borrower, a
real bank's book or a real economy, and no parameter in it is calibrated,
validated or approved for any purpose.

Coherent, not independently random
----------------------------------
Section 5 asks for known numerical fixtures and coherent relationships rather
than independent random columns, and the difference matters: a book whose
ratings, PDs, statements, covenants and collateral move independently cannot
support a genuine analytical question, and an analysis of it would look
plausible while meaning nothing. So one latent quality process per borrower
drives everything downstream:

    macro cycle + borrower drift  ->  latent quality
    latent quality               ->  rating, and the PIT PD around it
    rating alone                 ->  the TTC PD (through the cycle: no macro)
    hazard curve over the actual remaining maturity -> lifetime PD
    term structure x LGD x EAD x discount, per scenario, weighted -> ECL
    the same quality process      ->  statement trajectory -> the forty ratios
    those ratios vs contractual thresholds -> covenant status and headroom

That last chain is what makes a covenant breach in this data mean something:
it happens because the borrower's DSCR actually fell, not because a breach
flag was drawn from a distribution.

What is deliberately imperfect
------------------------------
Real books have gaps, and a demo without them teaches the wrong lesson. This
release carries missing valuations, carried-forward annual statements that are
not new quarterly observations, unanswered qualitative questions, covenants
not yet due, facilities originating and closing part-way through the window,
collateral shared across facilities, and macro forecasts whose vintages
disagree with the actuals that later arrived.

This module is not on the answer path. It writes Parquet; the runtime reads
it. No model calls it and it computes nothing at query time.
