"""
Counting tokens before a request, against the model that will serve it.
Specification section 9.3, and the owner's instruction for this UAT phase.

Why a provider count and not an estimate
----------------------------------------
The local estimate this package shipped with is a character heuristic. It is
conservative by design, but it is still a guess about a tokenizer, and the
tokenizer differs between model families. A guess that is 20% low lets an
oversized packet through and the request fails at the provider with a 400 that
tells the user nothing useful; a guess that is 20% high refuses work that would
have fit.

So `count` asks the provider to count, for the exact model that will serve the
request, through `client.messages.count_tokens`. The local estimate stays as
the fallback for when there is no credential or the endpoint is unreachable,
and every result says which method produced it -- an estimate must never be
reported as a measurement.

The counting endpoint is itself a network call
-----------------------------------------------
Section 9.3 requires that provider token-counting activity be tracked
separately and never become an unbounded preflight loop. `Counter` therefore
caches by payload fingerprint, bounds the number of counting calls per request,
and records every one. It does not consume the request's model-call budget --
counting is not inference -- but it is reported, because an unmeasured network
call in the hot path is how a latency budget quietly disappears.
