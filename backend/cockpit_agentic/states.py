"""
The server-owned state machine, as an explicit transition registry.

The model requests transitions; this module alone approves them. A response
cannot set its own attempts remaining, bypass a prior refusal, reopen a
stopped request or acquire another module's data -- because none of those are
expressible here. `Machine.advance` is the only way a request changes state,
it checks the edge against `TRANSITIONS`, and a terminal state has no
outgoing edges at all.

Why a registry rather than an adjacency list
--------------------------------------------
An adjacency list says a transition is permitted. It does not say what causes
it, under what condition, or what it costs -- so a reviewer asking "can this
request loop forever?" has to reconstruct the answer from the runtime. The
registry below carries EVENT, CONDITION and SIDE_EFFECT on every edge, and the
side effect is where boundedness lives: each edge that returns to PLANNING
consumes something that cannot be replenished, so every cycle is finite by
construction rather than by discipline.

`tests/cockpit_agentic/test_state_machine.py` reads this table and proves the
properties that matter: every non-terminal state has an exit, every declared
edge names a real state, every path terminates, and no cycle is unbounded.
