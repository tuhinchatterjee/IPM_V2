"""
Thread continuity in the restricted domain. Specification section 12.

A recent exchange is one COMPLETE question and its final answer, referral or
clarification — not one message. At question twenty the default context is
question twenty, the stored rolling summary, and complete pairs seventeen
through nineteen.

Three defaults, and what moves between them
-------------------------------------------
Three pairs by default, normally at most five when the question needs them, an
absolute maximum of eight, and all of it under the mode's history token cap.
`select` applies both bounds and reports which one bit, because "we sent three
pairs" and "we sent three pairs because eight would not fit" are different
facts about an answer.

An explicitly referenced older exchange can displace a less relevant recent one
INSIDE the same cap — it does not raise it.

The boundary applies to memory too
----------------------------------
Section 6.4: thread history, summaries and caches obey the domain boundary. A
result created by another module, or by an earlier and broader Cockpit, does
not become authorized by appearing in an old answer. So every stored exchange
carries its domain and release, and `select` drops the ones that do not match
rather than trusting that they were fine when they were written.

A referral is remembered as a referral. Summarising it as though the analysis
had been performed would let the NEXT question be answered against a memory of
work that never happened.
