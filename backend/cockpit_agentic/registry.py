"""
Which functionality owns what. Specification section 6.1.

Descriptions come from the application, not from a model
--------------------------------------------------------
Every entry below was checked against `frontend/src/lib/navigation.ts` and the
backend packages at the base commit. Section 6.1 requires the registry to carry
the ACTUAL UI label and a VERIFIED navigation route, and `verify_routes` asserts
that against the file rather than trusting this docstring.

Two places where the specification's names and the product's differ, and the
product wins:

* **Credit Scoring has no module.** There is no `/credit-scoring` route and no
  workflow that assigns a borrower a new score. `backend/scorecard/` builds and
  fits scorecards and `/scorecard-validation` validates them; neither
  originates a score for a borrower. Section 6.1 anticipates exactly this and
  says to keep the ownership exclusion and state that the correct workflow is
  unavailable -- so the entry is present, `enabled=False`, with no route and an
  honest reason. Cockpit still refuses to generate a score; it just cannot
  promise a screen that would.
* **What-If Analysis ships as "What-If Analysis", at `/what-if`.** It used to
  ship as "Stress Testing" at `/stress`, and this registry said so, because
  that was true when the Cockpit branch forked. The What-If rebuild renamed
  both. `/stress` is kept as a redirect for links already in the wild, but it
  is no longer a menu item, so referring anyone to it would send them looking
  for something that is not there -- which is the exact failure this entry was
  written to avoid, pointed the other way.

Ownership is about the ACTION, not the vocabulary
-------------------------------------------------
"Show the stored rating" and "calculate a new rating" name the same noun and
belong to different functionalities. The `examples` and `counterexamples` on
each entry are pairs like that, because a score cannot separate them and a
boundary drawn on keywords would put both in the same place.
