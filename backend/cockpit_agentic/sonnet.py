"""
The two preprocessing passes and the rolling-summary update.
Specification sections 7.2, 7.3, 7.9 and 13.

Three bounded, schema-constrained calls, and nothing else
---------------------------------------------------------
Sonnet cleans and translates (pass 1), normalizes into a business request
(pass 2), and — once, after the answer is already rendered — updates the
rolling thread summary. It never chooses a method, never scores which
functionality owns the question, never computes anything and never names a
field: it has not seen the catalogue and there is no field in any of its
contracts for it to put one in.

Failure does not rewrite intent
-------------------------------
A failed pass 1 preserves the raw question and continues with the failure
flagged, because a fluent sentence that means something else is far worse than
an untranslated one. A failed pass 2 does the same. Section 7.3 forbids a third
cleanup loop, so there is no retry here beyond the provider's own single
transient one, and the flag travels into the context packet where Opus can see
that normalization was unreliable.

The summary call is the only one that happens after the user has their answer,
and section 7.9 is explicit that its failure must not erase a completed answer.
It cannot: `update_summary` returns the previous summary unchanged and records
the exchange as unsummarized for next time.
