"""
One request, end to end. Specification sections 8, 9 and 11.

This is the server-owned state machine. The model requests transitions; this
approves them, updates the counters atomically, and stops.

The four properties this module is responsible for
--------------------------------------------------
**The gate is first and it is real.** Nothing reaches the validator before
`decision.may_execute` is true. A referral or a clarification returns from
`FUNCTIONALITY_ASSESSMENT` without ever entering `VALIDATING`, so "a referral
performs zero analytical executions" is structural rather than a promise.

**CreditProbe never authors a repair.** On failure it builds an
`ExecutionFailurePacket` and returns it to Opus. There is no branch in this
file that writes or edits SQL. `_execute_submission` runs what it was given.

**The counters are global and they do not reset.** Five submissions and three
rounds for the whole request, enforced by the ledger, which raises rather than
returns. A new plan does not buy a sixth attempt because `note_submission` does
not know what plan asked.

**A stop is honest.** Whatever ends the request -- the gate, the budget, the
deadline, an unrepairable failure, insufficient evidence -- the user gets an
envelope that says what was understood, what was tried, why it stopped and what
would help. There is no fallback to a deterministic narrative engine and no
canned decomposition standing in for an unavailable model (sections 17 and 18).
