"""
Which model does which job, and how much of it to spend.

Why roles rather than one model
-------------------------------
CreditProbe asks a model four different things, and they are not the same
difficulty:

* **routing** — is this a catalogue question or an analysis? Short, structured,
  and answered correctly by a fast model almost every time.
* **planning** — read a compound multi-domain request into a governed plan. The
  hardest thing in the product, and where an error is most expensive: a plan
  that is subtly wrong produces a confident, reconciled, wrong answer.
* **interpretation** — say in a sentence what a computed result means. Bounded,
  because the figures are already fixed and the model may not add any.
* **critic** — repair a plan the validator rejected, told what was wrong.

Sending all four to one model means either paying planning prices for routing
or accepting planning quality from a routing model. Neither is a decision worth
making by accident, so the roles are configuration.

No invented model ids
---------------------
Nothing here names a model. Every id comes from the environment; where a role
has no id of its own it falls back to `AI_MODEL`, and where that is empty the
provider's own pinned default applies. A configured id that the provider cannot
serve is a **configuration failure that says so**, not a silent substitution —
a demo answered by a different model from the one that was certified is a demo
whose certification means nothing.
