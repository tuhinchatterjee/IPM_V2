"""
What CreditProbe needs from a language model, and nothing more.

The orchestrator asks a model for exactly one thing: a **structured document**
that conforms to a schema CreditProbe supplied. It never asks for prose that will
be parsed into a decision, and it never asks for a figure. That constraint is
what lets the provider be swapped without touching the analytical path, and it
is why this interface has one method.

Why schema-constrained rather than "return JSON"
------------------------------------------------
A model asked for JSON in prose returns JSON *most* of the time. The failure is
not that parsing throws — that is recoverable — but that a plausible-looking
object with a misspelled key silently loses a filter, and the analysis then
answers a slightly different question with complete confidence. So the schema is
enforced at the provider boundary: the model is given a tool whose input schema
IS the contract, and a reply that does not call that tool is an error rather
than something to salvage.

Why no streaming
----------------
Nothing downstream can start until the whole plan is known — the validator
rejects partial plans by construction. Streaming would add a failure mode and
buy nothing.
