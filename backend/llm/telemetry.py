"""
What actually happened when CreditProbe called the model.

The defect this module exists to close
--------------------------------------
The product used to compute "is the AI connected?" as `bool(api_key)`. A key
that was expired, a model name the provider had retired, a laptop behind a
corporate proxy — all three reported CONNECTED, and every question quietly fell
through to the offline reader while the banner said otherwise. A user cannot
debug what the product will not admit.

So connection is now an **observation, not a configuration**. CONNECTED means a
real structured response came back. Nothing else earns that word.

What is recorded
----------------
Safe metadata only, and the list is closed: provider, model, purpose, when, how
long, whether it worked, the provider's own request id, whether the structured
output validated, and — on failure — a category and a sanitised reason.

The API key is never read by this module, never stored, and never appears in a
failure string: `_sanitise` strips anything that looks like one before a reason
is kept. That is belt and braces, because a provider's own exception text is not
under our control.
