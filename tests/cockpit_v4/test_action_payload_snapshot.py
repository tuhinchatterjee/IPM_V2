"""REAL DATABASE · MODEL MOCK · UNIT. What is actually sent on an action.

§6, §17. The two questions that failed on the Mac, measured -- system bytes,
tool-schema bytes, seed bytes, conversation bytes, counted tokens -- and
asserted against bounds rather than described.

Why bounds and not a golden file
--------------------------------
A byte-for-byte snapshot of a 45-kilobyte request fails on every wording
change and teaches a reader nothing about why it moved. What matters is the
shape: the action turn carries the governed measures it needs to author SQL,
does NOT carry the product pack or the answer contract, names this book's
release and calendar once, asks the analyst to restate nothing, and is
bounded in what it may cost.

The numbers in the bounds are the measured ones with headroom, so a change
that doubles the action payload fails here and a change that trims it does
not.

#: The measured ceiling for one analytical ACTION request, in bytes on the
#: wire.
#:
#: The plain question measures 52.1KB and the seeded one 60.1KB, of which
#: the analysis packet is a few hundred bytes -- the thing that stops a
#: seeded thread going to look for its own relation, segment value and
#: periods, and worth every byte it costs. Both were about 8KB larger
#: before the compaction round: the product pack and the answer half of
#: `finalize_response` came off.
#:
#: RE-BASELINED IN THE FIRST-LIVE-UAT REPAIR, by 142 measured bytes.
#:
#: The bound stood at 52,000 against a measured 51,926 -- seventy-four
#: bytes of headroom -- and H-LIVE-03 needs one rule ON THE ACTION TURN,
#: because the action turn is where the decision it governs is made:
#:
#:     "Once you can name the measure, dimension, book and period a data
#:      question means, RUN IT -- never ask permission to do what was just
#:      asked."
#:
#: The live analyst understood a typo-heavy data question completely and
#: then published PRODUCT_HELP / unsupported with an offer to proceed if
#: the reader said "go ahead". Opening the tool surface (`action_state`)
#: makes that possible; this sentence is what makes it expected. It was
#: paid for where it could be: the policy rule the same round needed moved
#: into `context.POLICY_RULE`, carried with the pack on the answer turn, so
#: it costs the action turn nothing. What is left is 142 bytes, and the
#: numbers below are the measurement rather than a round figure with room
#: in it: the headroom is 32 bytes, as tight as the 74 it replaces.
MAX_ACTION_BYTES = 52_100
#: A seeded thread pays for its seed. Bounded separately so the allowance
#: for one cannot quietly become the allowance for the other.
MAX_SEEDED_ACTION_BYTES = 60_100
#: The tool schemas alone. The full contract is ~16.8KB; the action set is
#: ~8.6KB because the answer half of `finalize_response` is not on it.
