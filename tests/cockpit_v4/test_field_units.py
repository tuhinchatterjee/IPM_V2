"""
Every unit this catalogue uses has a stated verdict.

NO MODEL · UNIT. No paid provider call.

`Field.additive` named four units on each side and returned "not_additive"
for everything else, so a unit it had never heard of was indistinguishable
from one deliberately judged non-additive. Three of the eleven units the
catalogue actually uses reached their answer that way, and one of them was
wrong: `notches` is a signed count of rating grades, `display` classes it
with `count`, published prose already totals it -- "a net movement of +7
notches" -- and the catalogue said it could not be added.

`schema.py`'s own docstring is where this test comes from: *"A field whose
unit is spelled inventively is a field whose figures get published wrong."*
A fallthrough is how that stays true silently. The pair of explicit sets is
the fix, and this file is what stops the next unit slipping past them.
