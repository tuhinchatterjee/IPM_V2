"""REAL DATABASE · MODEL MOCK · UNIT. What an ACTION turn is allowed to be.

The live failure this suite exists for
--------------------------------------
Two ordinary Corporate questions -- "What is driving Stage 2 and ECL
growth?" and a seeded Construction investigation -- each spent about eighty
seconds in "Understanding the request", used the one action-format recovery,
and stopped at CALL_LIMIT with no query executed.

Four things made that possible, and each one has assertions here:

1. `tool_choice` was a parameter `Analyst.ask` accepted and never sent, so a
   turn whose only legal outcome was a tool call was free to write an essay.
2. The action turn carried the FULL `finalize_response` contract -- nine
   kilobytes describing narrative, claims, tables, charts and follow-ups --
   which is an answer's schema handed to a turn that cannot answer.
3. The action turn was given the ANSWER's output allowance, so there was
   room for four thousand tokens of prose before anything had to be decided.
4. One provider call could block for the whole remaining deadline, so the
   first action could spend the budget the second action needed.

None of these is about what the model is good at. They are about what the
request permitted.
