The live answer to "What is ECL coverage of exposure?" returned one row:

    ecl_total            224.556...      SAR million
    ead_total          19738.832...      SAR million
    balance_total      19619.224...      SAR million
    limit_total        35932.222...      SAR million
    cov_on_ead_pct         1.1376...     percent
    cov_on_balance_pct     1.1445...     percent
    cov_on_limit_pct       0.6249...     percent

and published `balance_total` as **19,619.22%** and `limit_total` as
**35,932.22%**. The narrative used the right concepts; the table a reader
looks at was materially wrong.

The unit came from `Finalizer._units_for`. Its first source is "a numeric
claim already bound to this artifact and column", and for a DERIVED claim it
read the claim's unit onto every operand column of the derivation. The only
appearance of `balance_total` in any claim was as the DENOMINATOR of a
coverage percentage, so it was published in percent. `ecl_total` and
`ead_total` escaped only because direct claims had already named them in SAR
million and `setdefault` keeps the first answer -- which is why two of the
four amounts were right and two were not.

The fix is a declaration in `derivation`, beside the operation table, of
which operations preserve their operands' unit -- `identity`, `sum`, `min`,
`max`, `difference` do; `percentage`, `ratio`, `share_of_total`,
`percentage_change`, `count` and `rank` do not, and `weighted_average`
preserves it for its values and not its weights. It is derived from the
arithmetic each operation performs. Nothing anywhere knows the name
`balance_total`.
