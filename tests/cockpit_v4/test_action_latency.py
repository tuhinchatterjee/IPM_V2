"""REAL DATABASE · MODEL MOCK · UNIT. Slow turns, and what survives them.

§10, §20. The Mac failure was not only a malformed action -- it was a
malformed action that took eighty seconds, on a run with a hundred and
twenty. By the time it came back there was no time to ask again, so a run
that had been stopped by ONE bad call reported a call limit.

The provider double here is not the scripted one: it SLEEPS, and it honours
the timeout it is given the way an HTTP client does -- if the turn would run
past its deadline, the caller gets a timeout instead of an answer. That is
the only way to show that bounding one action leaves room for the next.

No paid call is made anywhere in this file. The latencies are simulated.
