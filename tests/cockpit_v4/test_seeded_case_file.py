"""MODEL MOCK · REAL DATABASE/RUNNER · REPRODUCTION.

A seeded investigation arrives with its schema, not with a relation dump.

The live defect
---------------
A user clicked the Manufacturing covenant card and asked a follow-up. The run
executed a query and got seven borrower rows back, and then spent the rest of
its deadline on provider turns. One catalogue call in that run returned
FIFTY-NINE field definitions: `cockpit_covenant_quarter` carries fifty-nine
columns in this release, no covenant column is among the canonical measures
the starting context already resolves, and so the only way the analyst could
ask about covenants at all was to ask for the whole relation.

The fix is not a smaller page size. It is that CreditProbe already knows which
columns that card was computed from -- it ran the SQL -- and can hand them
over before the first model call. What it must NOT hand over is a method: the
case file says what the fields are, never which one answers the question.
