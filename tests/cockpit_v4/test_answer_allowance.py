"""
The answer turn could not fit its own answer.

MODEL MOCK · REAL DATABASE/RUNNER · REAL API. No paid provider call.

Thread `th-48fdeffe125f489592f627e307852e31` executed its query and then was
cut off writing the answer about it, twice, and stopped as
`ANSWER_FORMAT_EXHAUSTED`. Stage 1 published the rows anyway. This is the
other half: why the answer could not be written, and why asking again could
not have helped.

It was arithmetic, not judgement. A correct answer to a four-step analysis --
sixteen claims, a narrative that references them, four tables and two charts
-- serializes to about 12.6 KB, which the run's own token estimator puts at
~5,700 tokens. The allowance was 4,096. The object did not overrun a generous
budget; it could not be emitted at any effort setting, and the re-ask was the
identical request at the identical size with "keep it compact" appended.

Four things were wrong and all four are asserted here:

  the allowance was too small          -> raised, and measured
  the re-ask was the same request      -> ceiling + lower effort
  one truncation spent the only re-ask -> two, and they are not shared
  the first attempt could eat the clock -> bounded while a successor exists
