"""
The result packet is input the answer turn has to pay for.

NO MODEL · UNIT. Nothing here calls a provider, scripted or otherwise: the
packet is constructed in memory and measured, because a byte count is a
property of the code, not of a run.

Every byte in a `tool_result` is read back on the answer turn, counted
against the context window, and billed. The live thread was cut off writing
its answer, and part of why is what it had to read first: a four-step,
100-row result measured ~116 KB, of which ~67 KB was the same rows a second
time and the same constant prose restated once per step.

This pins the shape after the shrink, in the same spirit as
`test_action_payload_snapshot.py` pins the request envelope: a bound, and
the reason it holds.
