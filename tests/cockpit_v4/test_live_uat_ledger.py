"""The scripted ledger and the paid ledger are different files.

UNIT · REPRODUCTION · REAL DATABASE. No model call, no paid provider call.

The defect
----------
The harness used ONE state database for both modes, deleted at startup. That
made the live pre-flight unanswerable. A dry run settles real reservations --
scripted token counts priced at the real card -- so it leaves a ledger with
committed spend in it, and "does this ledger begin at zero?" then depends on
whether that spend was real.

Nothing in the store can answer that. The schema records no provider and no
model: `runs`, `reservations` and `events` have no such column, and a full
dry-run event stream contains ZERO occurrences of "model". `startup_sha` is
the harness's own constant in both modes. Telling a scripted reservation from
a paid one after the fact is not merely awkward here -- it is not possible
without changing the product's schema.

So the two are never mixed. The mode picks the path; the live ledger is never
deleted by the harness; and a live run that finds anything in its ledger
refuses to start and says where the file is. Moving a paid record aside is an
operator's decision, and a spend control that made it silently would be doing
the one thing it exists to prevent.
