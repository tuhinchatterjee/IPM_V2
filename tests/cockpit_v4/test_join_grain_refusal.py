"""
A refusal that says it was a refusal.

MODEL MOCK · REAL DATABASE/RUNNER. No paid provider call.

A step stopped by the join-grain check or by a missing Python sandbox used
to be reported as a query that RAN and failed: `phase: "runtime"`,
`executed: true`, and a reader told "<purpose> failed while running" about a
batch in which the engine was never asked for anything. Two lines did it --
a two-valued `phase` switch that called everything-not-bind a runtime
failure, and an `executed` exclusion tuple that named three checks out of
nine.

Underneath was a placement bug. `multiplication_risk` is a judgement about
the query TEXT -- a regex plus a catalogue read, no engine, no parameters,
no earlier artifact -- yet it ran inside `_run_sql`, so the fan-out refusal
fired after the step budget was spent and after the run had publicly
announced the very query it refuses. Three of the four branches around it
could not execute, and the fourth turned a broken diagnostic into a clean
bill of health.

What is pinned here:

  the rung is derived, once        -> phase and executed cannot disagree
  the check runs before anything   -> refused above TOOL_VALIDATED
  the refusal carries its evidence -> facts, not a sentence to regex
  a one-to-one join repeats nothing -> and is no longer refused
  a query that really ran          -> still says so
