"""REAL RELEASE · REAL VALUES · NO MODEL.

§23-§30. The live failure was a follow-up of five words:

    "and within prject finance?"

The run answered it by asking the catalogue for `product_name`, then
`product_category`, then `product_type`, then `product`, then
`product_code`. It had `product_type` in the first call. What it did not
have was any way to decide that the string the reader typed was the string
the book spells `Project Finance`, so it kept looking for a field that would
obviously contain it -- and invented field names when none did.

That is VALUE RESOLUTION, and it is a different question from SCHEMA
RESOLUTION. This file tests it as one: against the values the releases
actually hold, read out of the releases, with no model in the loop.
