"""REAL RELEASES · NO MODEL.

§14-§22. How big the books are, and whether there is anything in them.

Why this exists
---------------
The Corporate release was ninety-seven borrowers and two hundred and ninety
facilities. Every consequence of that was invisible until somebody asked a
real question of it on a real Mac:

  * "EAD by sub-sector" returned rows holding a single obligor, so
    "sub-sector" and "borrower" were the same dimension wearing two names;
  * the twenty largest exposures WERE a fifth of the book, so every
    concentration answer was trivially true;
  * every latency figure was measured against a database small enough to fit
    in a cache line, so "fast" said nothing about the engine.

So this file asserts the SHAPE of the published books -- the counts, the
depth of each dimension, and the presence of the authored stories -- against
the releases themselves. It is not a test of the generator's source; it reads
what was actually published.
