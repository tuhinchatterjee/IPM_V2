"""REAL DATABASE · MODEL MOCK · UNIT. Convergence, across the whole surface.

§21, §22, §23. The two Mac failures were not special questions. They were
ordinary ones, which is why a fix that only made those two pass would be
worth very little.

So: every common analytical question in both books, a five-step follow-up
chain in each, and every attention family that the engine actually produces
a card for -- each driven through the real orchestrator, and each required
to PUBLISH rather than merely to execute something.

What the scripted analyst does here matters. It authors its SQL from the
relation and columns the OPENING PACKET resolved -- `semantics.readiness`
for a plain question, the analysis packet for a seeded one -- and never from
a catalogue lookup. A question whose packet did not carry enough to write a
query would fail here, which is the claim §7 and §8 make.
