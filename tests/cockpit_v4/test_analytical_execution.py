"""
Analytical execution: what may block it, what must bind, and what it costs.

Evidence: REAL DATABASE for every number — the queries run against the pinned
release through the real DuckDB session — and MODEL MOCK for the runs, which
use the scripted provider. No paid provider call is made in this module.

Three defects are pinned here, each from a live run:

  * a declared resolution ("exposure read as reported EAD") refused the
    analysis it made possible;
  * "Query validated" was announced before DuckDB had been asked whether the
    query bound at all, and `steps[].parameters` never reached the engine;
  * a Standard analytical run ran out of a sixty-second deadline and a
    one-dollar ceiling that were set for a product question.
