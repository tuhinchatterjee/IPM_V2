"""REAL DATABASE · REAL ROUTES · REAL WORKER · EVERY PATH.

§1, §17, §18. Two analytical books, and no silent cross-domain fallback on
any surface.

Why an AUDIT rather than a test per feature
-------------------------------------------
Every previous round fixed the leak it was shown. The dashboard leaked, and
the dashboard was fixed. Investigate Further opened the wrong book, and
Investigate Further was fixed. The export named the wrong period, and the
export was fixed. Each fix was correct and none of them prevented the next
one, because a leak is not a property of a feature -- it is a property of any
path that takes a domain from somewhere other than the thread.

So this enumerates the SURFACES and checks the rule on each: every path that
serves a book must serve the book it was asked for, must refuse the other
book by name rather than answering from the one in front of it, and must not
carry the other book's release, relations, periods or vocabulary.

A route added later without a row here is what the last assertion is for.
