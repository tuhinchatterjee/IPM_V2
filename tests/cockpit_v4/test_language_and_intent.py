"""
Real-world input: misspelling, telegraphic English, long paragraphs, and
other languages.

Evidence: UNIT for the normalisation and coverage rules, MODEL MOCK for the
runs -- the analyst is scripted, so these establish that the PIPELINE treats
every phrasing identically and preserves what must survive. They establish
nothing about what Opus writes; that is the live UAT's job and it is labelled
as such.

The thing under test is a boundary, not a model. CreditProbe may normalise
Unicode and whitespace and nothing else, so a misspelled, telegraphic or
mixed-language question must reach the analyst byte-identical apart from
that, must route through the same ownership and the same fields, and must
produce the same number.
