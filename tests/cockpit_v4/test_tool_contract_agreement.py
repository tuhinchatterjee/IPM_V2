"""
UNIT. No model, no database, no runner.

The model-facing schema and the server validator must agree MECHANICALLY.

The live defect: the first product-help run answered correctly in 16.6
seconds and was refused because `clarification_question` was `null` — a
representation the schema it was given explicitly permits. CreditProbe then
forced a second full generation: 2 calls, 29.4 seconds and ~$0.162 for a
question that needs one call.

The fix is not prompt wording. It is that every absence the schema advertises
is an absence the validator accepts, and that every field the validator
demands is a field the schema requires.
