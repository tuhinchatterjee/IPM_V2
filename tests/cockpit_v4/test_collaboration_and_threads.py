"""
What a credit officer does after reading an answer, and across five sessions.

MODEL MOCK · REAL DATABASE · REAL HTTP (in-process ASGI client).

Two things are proven here and one is deliberately not.

PROVEN: a finished analysis can be saved, gathered into an investigation,
commented on, shared with a named colleague, and that every one of those is
tenant-scoped -- a second tenant holding the same identifier sees nothing.

PROVEN: the notification outbox records what would be sent and reports
`delivered: false` with the reason, because this build has no transport and
an empty recipient allow-list. A recipient outside the allow-list is REFUSED
and never reaches a transport at all.

NOT CLAIMED: that any message was delivered. No external mail, chat or
webhook call is made by this module, and the one test that exercises a
transport installs a recording double whose name appears on the row so the
audit can tell it apart from a real one.
