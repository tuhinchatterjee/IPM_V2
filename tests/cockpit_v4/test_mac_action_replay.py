"""REAL DATABASE · MODEL MOCK · REPRODUCTION. The two Mac CALL_LIMIT runs.

What happened on the Mac
------------------------
Two ordinary Corporate questions were asked against a correct backend --
`v4-saudi-corporate-20q-v3`, quarterly, 20 periods, latest 2026Q2 -- and
both produced the same screen:

    Request accepted
    Understanding the request              ~80s
    (response cut off before the stage completed; asking again)
    one structure-regeneration attempt used
    CALL_LIMIT

No query ran. No answer was published. The questions were:

  1. "What is driving Stage 2 and ECL growth?"
  2. "What drove the change in Recognised ECL for Construction in 2026Q2?"
     -- asked in a thread seeded from the Construction ECL card.

These replays use the REAL shape of that failure: the first action turn ends
at its output allowance with nothing complete in it, which is what
`stop_reason: "max_tokens"` means and what `OutputTruncated` is. They are
not a happy-path stub with a retry bolted on.

Two different things are asserted, and both matter:

  * given ONE bad action turn, the run now recovers, executes and publishes
    -- because the retry is a turn that cannot answer in prose, carries no
    answer contract, and has time left to make;
  * given TWO bad action turns, the run still stops at CALL_LIMIT -- bounded
    is the point, and a run that retried forever would be a worse failure
    than the one being fixed.
