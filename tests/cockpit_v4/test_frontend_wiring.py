"""
REAL PROCESS · REAL HTTP · UNIT.

The launcher/frontend wiring defect and its neighbours.

The defect: the launcher set only `NEXT_PUBLIC_COCKPIT_V4_API`, so the V4
Cockpit client talked to the V4 API while the application shell, the
backend-status badge and every landing-page widget kept talking to
`http://127.0.0.1:8000` — a backend the V4 instance never started. Half the
page reported a system that was not there.

The second defect: the launcher JSON-decoded the UI's root page, which serves
HTML, so a healthy UI was reported as never becoming ready.
