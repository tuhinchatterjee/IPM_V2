"""MODEL MOCK · REAL DATABASE/RUNNER · UNIT.

Where a run's time and context actually went, per model call.

The defect this exists for
--------------------------
A live analytical run executed its query, returned seven borrower rows, and
then spent the rest of its deadline. The trace said the run stopped; it did
not say how many model calls were made, what each was for, how large each
request had grown, or whether the wall-clock went to the provider or to
CreditProbe assembling requests. "The model is slow" and "we spent the
deadline building payloads" looked identical from the outside.

`Analyst.turns` already existed and was never read by anything. It is now a
record of every generation ATTEMPT -- including the ones refused before they
were sent, which are precisely the ones a stopped run needs explained -- and
it reaches the reader on the outcome.
