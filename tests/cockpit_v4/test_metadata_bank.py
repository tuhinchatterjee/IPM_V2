"""REAL CATALOGUE · NO MODEL · BOTH BOOKS.

§37. D01-D10: the metadata questions, asked of each book's own catalogue.

These are the questions a reader asks before an analytical one -- what is in
here, what does this column mean, how do these tables join, what does this
book NOT have. Every answer is served by `CatalogService` from the book the
request is scoped to, so the same question asked in the two books returns two
different, correct answers rather than one answer with a label swapped.

The model is not involved. What is under test is whether the catalogue can
ANSWER, not whether an analyst chooses to ask.
