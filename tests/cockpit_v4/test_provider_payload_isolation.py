"""MODEL MOCK · REAL CONTEXT PATH · BOTH BOOKS.

§4. What the live provider is ACTUALLY sent, inspected byte by byte.

Why this file exists
-------------------
Every automated suite in the build was green while a real Opus run against
the monthly Corporate book replied "this book is recorded quarterly, not
monthly" and offered 2026Q2. The scripted suites could not see it because a
scripted analyst does not READ its instructions or its tool schema — it
returns whatever the test told it to.

So this captures the payload the real Anthropic adapter would be handed, by
driving the SAME worker through the SAME context path with a provider that
records what it was given and then raises. No reduced shortcut: the system
blocks, the first user message and the tool schemas are exactly the ones a
paid call would carry.

The three leaks it exists to stop, all found here
-------------------------------------------------
1. `prompts/analyst.md` worked its resolved-assumption example in quarters:
   "period not specified: latest populated quarter 2026Q2, against 2026Q1".
2. Every tool schema carried the same sentence, and `execute_analysis` named
   its field `reporting_quarters`. The analyst believes the CONTRACT over the
   catalogue, correctly, because the contract is what it has to fill in.
3. The module registry told it the Cockpit owns "the twenty-quarter corporate
   domain", which is true of neither book.
