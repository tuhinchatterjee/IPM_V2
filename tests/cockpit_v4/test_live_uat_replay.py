"""REAL API · REAL BOOKS · MODEL MOCKED OR REFUSING · THE FOUR MAC FAILURES.

§36. Each of these is one thing a person did on a Mac, against real Opus,
written down here as the sequence they performed and the outcome they got.

The automated dual-domain suite was green while all four were live, because
every one of them is invisible to a scripted analyst: a scripted analyst does
not read its instructions, does not read its tool schema, does not decide
what its question means, and does not run out of time. So these replay the
READER's sequence and assert on what the system does around the model --
which payload it sends, which book it opens, which clock it starts, and what
it has already resolved before the first generation.
