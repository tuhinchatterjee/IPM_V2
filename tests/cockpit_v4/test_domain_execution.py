"""MODEL MOCK · REAL DATABASE/RUNNER · INDEPENDENT ORACLE.

Two books, executed. The round this replaces refused Retail questions rather
than letting one run against corporate relations; these are the regressions
that make the refusal unnecessary.

What is scripted and what is not
--------------------------------
The model is scripted, so nothing here claims anything about answer quality.
Everything else is real: the run is persisted with its domain and release, the
worker resolves the book from THAT record, a real DuckDB session is
materialized from that book's own parquet, the submitted SQL runs in it, and
every published figure is checked against a pandas oracle that never touches
the catalogue, the session or the product's SQL.

The isolation cases are the point of the file. A corporate run that names a
retail relation must be refused by name; a retail run must never see a
corporate relation; and the two runs must not be able to reach each other's
numbers through a cache, a session or a release header.
