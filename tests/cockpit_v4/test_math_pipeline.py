"""
Fifteen mathematical questions, end to end, through the real V4 pipeline.

MODEL MOCK · REAL DATABASE/RUNNER · REAL VALIDATOR. No paid provider call.

The loop is the real one and nothing is short-circuited:

    generation -> execute_analysis -> SQL validation and bind proof ->
    DuckDB -> result packet -> generation -> finalize_response ->
    evidence validation -> published answer

The scripted analyst builds its final answer FROM THE RESULT PACKET -- it
reads the row ids the packet published and cites those. It never reads the
oracle. So when a published figure matches `math_bank.oracle()` afterwards,
that is the pipeline agreeing with an independent pandas calculation, not a
test agreeing with itself.

The bar is the one the round set: a query that executes but whose answer is
rejected is a FAILURE, and a good narrative with wrong numbers is a FAILURE.
