`intent must be an object`, and the run that dies of it.

The defect this module exists for
---------------------------------
Live analytical questions -- "What is driving Stage 2 and ECL growth?",
"ecl decomposition" -- ended with that sentence on the user's screen. Two
separate faults, chained:

1. `intent` was REQUIRED on all five tools. It is a nine-field object and the
   analyst had to restate it verbatim on every catalogue read, every artifact
   read, every execution and the final answer -- four or five times per run,
   for a declaration that does not change between them. A field restated for
   no reason is a field that will eventually be sent wrong, and the answer to
   that is not a sterner instruction; it is to stop asking.

2. When the restatement did come back malformed, the run was ALSO still on
   the Product Help allowance -- sixty seconds -- because the allowance was
   widened inside `_record_intent`, which never ran. So a format slip on a
   field nobody needed twice spent the recovery budget and then the clock,
   and the run died with the parser's sentence as its public message.

What is fixed here
------------------
`intent` is authored once and carried. The server already holds it; a later
call that omits it inherits the run's, and one that restates it may refine
it. The analyst still owns the intent -- what it no longer owns is the
obligation to retype it.

An `intent` that arrives as a JSON STRING of the object is accepted, because
that is a real provider behaviour and re-deriving an object from it is
mechanical.

And the analytical allowance is adopted when an ANALYTICAL TOOL is called,
not when a field parses. Calling `execute_analysis` is itself the
declaration; nothing about the budget needs the model to say it twice.

#: an unexplained regression. What IS established is that `intent` was
#: restated four or five times a run for no reason, and that the analytical
