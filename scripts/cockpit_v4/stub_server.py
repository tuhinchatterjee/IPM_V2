Run the real V4 API with a scripted analyst, for browser testing.

Everything here is the real thing except the model: the real routes, the real
durable store, the real worker and supervisor, the real event stream, and the
real DuckDB session against the published release. Only `converse` is
scripted.

The script is chosen by the QUESTION, so one server covers every browser
scenario without the test reaching in to reconfigure it between cases:

    "Who are you?"          one call, a product-help answer
    "...fail..."            an application failure with a support reference
    "...slow..."            a stalled run, so cancel and refresh have
                            something to act on
    anything else           a real SQL analysis over the release

Usage:

CreditProbe is an intelligent credit-investigation layer for risk teams. It helps a senior credit officer move from seeing a risk signal to understanding why it matters, deciding what should happen next, and aligning the organisation around the evidence.

## The problem CreditProbe addresses

Credit teams usually have plenty of information — exposure, ECL, ratings, financials, covenants, collateral, behavioural signals and committee material. The difficulty is connecting those pieces quickly enough to answer:

- Where is risk building?
- Why is it happening?
- Which borrowers matter?
- What should the committee discuss?

## How CreditProbe helps

**Cockpit** — interrogate the recorded credit book, identify movement and explain drivers.

**Early Warning** — identify emerging deterioration using behavioural, financial, external and relationship evidence.

**What-If** — test prospective shocks and understand portfolio impact.

Together: **Detect → Diagnose → Decide → Drive Alignment.**

The senior credit officer remains accountable for judgement and approval; CreditProbe accelerates the investigation and connects the evidence.

This environment uses synthetic demonstration data rather than a real bank portfolio."""
