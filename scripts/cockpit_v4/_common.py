"""
Shared launcher plumbing: ports, owned-process records, health, printing.

The rule that matters in every function here: V4 touches only what V4 owns.

A busy port is REPORTED, never freed. A process is stopped only when its
recorded pid, start time, command line AND working directory all still match
the record V4 wrote when it started it -- because a pid is reused within
minutes on a busy Mac, and `kill $(lsof -ti:8414)` on a reused pid stops
whatever happens to be there now. That is how a demo dies mid-presentation.
